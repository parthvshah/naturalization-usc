 So you don't need to go borrow equipment from anybody
 to
 to do the feet
 Do the hooves
 Well
 something
 So
 Mae
 I'm gonna
 to do those
 cause y
 n you just
 it takes
 and I'm not as good
 as like somebody that would do it all the time
 You know
 I mean
 Oh
 I'm not

 I don't know how to say it
 most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time
 and I'm not that good or
 and I'm not very strong
 Did they train you
 2Did2 they train you that
 yeah
 So you have your own equipment

 No
 Dad
 you know
 of kinda how to do it
 or
 people come to our place
 and
 I don't know
 down there

 you have to
 you have to take this class
 And you can only take
 And
 if you wanna go on in it
 you n
 And I decided to go ahead and go on in it
 And the first part of it
 is like
 well we have lecture
 then we have lab
 And like
 we just go into the classroom
 In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work
 I mean
 it
 they go over
 the whole
 the whole part of the horse
 I mean
 all the skeleton part of it you know
 and
 and they go through every kinda ligament
 millions of ligaments
 and millions of tendons
 I mean
 and then
 and then
 and
 you know
 You know
 and then
 the bone in the hoof
 then all the wall
 you know
 he went over on how to trim it
 and where you
 and a horse has this little white line
 and you clean it out with the
 with the hoof knife
 and then there
 and then you can see this little white line
 and that's kinda where you go by
 to
 SM you know
 has that little white line right the re
 and that 's where you kinda SM
 kinda need a little guide
 And
 I am still scared to do it
 I mean
 By doing it
 And make em
 and they're just a little bit
 for f
 I mean they're just sore
 That's not bad
 And they m
 they have to
 keep em
 away from anything
 no hard pebbles
 or hard clods of dirt or anything
 So
 I don't know
 I'm a little scared about doing it yet
 When I get done with them
 SM A lot of times
 and I'll look at
 and it's still
 it's too long
 And then like
 I would never
 ever
 ever
 to shoe a horse
 See we did that too
 we did
 We did a lot of stuff
 we did a lot of stuff with the

 the burners
 and you'd put the
 you'd have
 you started out with the straight iron
 you know
 and you'd stick it into the
 into the
 you know like
 And you'd put it into the hot SM coals
 And then
 we'd
 and we'd make it a
 But

 We just put the shoes that were already made
 And that's as far as we got
 Well as a matter of fact
 this is really funny
 there isn't really any girl farriers around anywhere
 They're really
 th Yeah
 And the m
 the reason they were showing us this at college
 to get us
 to know if our trimmer
 and shoer were_s doing it right
 and
 plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments
 we had it in another class too
 we
 that was kind of a double thing that
 we had in
 in another class
 well it was a review for some people
 if it was a review or not
 But
 anyway

 PAR P what was I gonna say
 I forgot what I was think
 Well
 w um
 when we put em on a horse's hoof
 they're already made
 they're round
 we pick out a size
 you know we'd
 this is a double aught
 this is
 what s
 and double aught and aught
 are the ones that are most popular
 For
 you know
 the
 that's a d
 Or ponies
 But we're talking just the regular
 light horses you know
 And
 aught and aught
 aught
 Well anyway
 you go get your
 Okay
 And you go get your shoe
 It's already made
 _You go look
 every horse is gonna have a little different shape
 And so what you have to 2do2
 So every
 2every2
 horseshoe is made
 No no
 No
 What
 then that's that's where the ferrier comes in
 Every shoe
 you get order
 You'd get
 The ferrier gets em
 You know
 And then
 _Our job
 to the horse's foot
 And that
 but it's really hard to do
 I mean
 some of em you have to
 you know
 say your shoe's like this
 and your horse's foot is just really wide or something
 Well then you have to put it on the anvil
 well then once you stretch the shoe out
 well then
 the two corners
 you know
 You stretch this out
 then you have to round these back
 you know
 It's just
 it s it sounds easy
 I would never do it
 I mean we had to do it
 it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod
 I mean
 that's
 thirty bucks
 for twenty horses
 I mean
 Jesus
 that would be a th nine hundred dollars
 SM I mean
 So
 w you know
 like
 that have a lot of horses and stuff
 and that they're riding a lot
 let the college kids do em
 For em you know
 They're taking the risk
 of having their horse get lame
 It really never happens
 And it's not like
 there's a person that's just gung ho
 trims their feet
 all the time I mean
 he e
 you know
 so it's
 But
 P PAR What was I gonna say PAR P
 Oh
 And it
 you get so
 I've only done like
 well
 at the end of the year
 And
 right now
 only shod about
 five horses
 Trimmed a lot of em
 And you know what we start out with
 We start out
 with
 dead horse hooves
 I mean
 you know
 The people that
 that
 kill the horses for meat and stuff
 You know they have all these legs and stuff
 And
 I don't know
 everybody
 I thought they used the the horsehooves in for gelatin
 HI You know
 then they
 they probably use em for everything
 But anyway
 we get these horse hooves
 they
 a long ways to go get em
 to get these horse hooves
 For the college
 They go back East
 So we have this frozen horse hoof
 cause you don't want to cripple up a really good horse
 that horse would have been
 lame
 like crazy
 But
 it was just
 sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit
 they start really stinking and stuff
 HI I mean
 you have this HI piece of horse
 HI I mean this leg that's HI
 And like in some of em
 blood will spurt out
 It's nothing
 SM it's the grossest thing SM
 And that's why
 that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory
 it's just the
 But once you get into it
 But
 I would have never got into that class
 if
 there's no way
 I heard everybody saying
 talking about
 VOX Oh
 and they stink VOX
 I'm never
 And then once I got into it
 But
 at first it was kind of a bummer
 But
 I'm glad I took it
 Really glad
 It pays off
 twelve bucks
 I mean that's twelve bucks
 You know
 with
 a horse that I was really using a lot
 that's still twelve dollars
 shoot
 But
 anybody
 I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing
 But anyway
 I wanna wait until the morning
 to do that
 because
 It's just
 too hot in the afternoon
 I mean you can get
 just
 exhausted
 Anyway
 I was gonna tell you about that
 the girl
 there isn't mary very many
 ferrier girls you know
 This summer I met one
 Jorgensen's
 they have one shoer
 And I guess like in Minnesota it's real wet
 and stuff you know
 they really have to watch their shoes
 It's like
 and they're not as dry or anything
 When you get back here
 we have to watch out for like
 like the hooves being too dry
 The
 Not this time of the year
 you know
 usually they're too wet
 and that
 that shoe can just pull right off
 the hoof wall is so soft
 Yeah
 you know
 and I nei
 I didn't realize that in
 you know
 Sure it's gonna be softer
 But I never even thought about that until I took this class
 So it's
 you know that's kinda stuff too that you think about
 But anyway
 they always have this one horseshoer
 this girl's been in this ferrier

 she's going to an actual ferrier college
 They have a lot of those around
 a lot
 And she's going to one of em
 like nine months
 to this one

 left to go
 What
 Guess I'll put it on

 she
 he's like taking her as a
 you know
 And
 it's really different
 you just don't see that
 at all
 ever
 Jorgensen's have a girl
 or a g
 you know a guy
 And they
 are
 there's this girl
 Yeah
 I couldn't believe it
 She's a tiny girl
 she's got arms the size of
 they're huge
 but she must only
 HI What is m blowing out of there HI
 it's just
 it gets dust accumulated in it
 It was just on last night
 I
 It Mae Lynne
 for one thing the filters are dirty because it it so
 been so dry
 And the
 it all comes acrost
 the road
 you know
 and
 and then it builds up real bad with
 deposits
 In other words I should be change filters
 God
 I know
 It won't last long
 But
 it sure does make a mess in the house
 Anyway
 I mean
 She's out there just
 working away
 And
 trim and trim and trim
 And shoe
 for me
 that's something I'm not used to
 you just
 HI it's HI tiring
 The very
 at the very beginning
 Then we moved up to two
 Then we moved up to a full horse
 And
 We were just slowly got in shape
 But now if I went to do that
 I'd never be able to handle it
 It's just
 it's a
 It is really hard work
 You're bent over
 and it's
 you know
 it takes like
 I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either
 it's just hard hard work
 It's
 it doesn't seem like it would be
 it is
 Those
 It's hard
 I've never been kicked
 But like
 most people's horse
 And they
 they don't get by with stuff
 you know
 horses at college
 it's like a kid
 are ornery
 And like
 kinda be ornery about half way
 but not not too bad
 I've never been kicked doing it at all
 And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know
 just had to learn our safety of
 where to stand
 You have to stand like these certain ways
 oh and it's a killer on your back
 You're standing

 You're standing like this you know
 And like
 the horse's hoof _lays like this right over you
 like this working
 This is like a hoof knife
 then a
 And like in the front
 You stick the horse's hoof between your leg
 Kinda like that
 It's really hard on your back
 Like
 I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous
 Couldn't believe it
 She had like on this really p kinda short shirt

 There's this
 I think that's cold
 Just don't
 it's
 it's just
 Makes a sound
 Nkay
 So what
 what were you gonna do out there today
 What other
 what other things were you gonna
 Just go out and
 Look at the filly
 Yeah
 I think more or less
 so late now
 Pretty much all we're gonna do is go out
 I don't know what her plans really are
 But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then
 maybe go to that seasonal dance
 Is that what it's called
 I don't know
 I don't know what it's called either
 You know
 Doing what
 The dance
 How he said there's four guys
 Since there's four seasons
 He's a pretty neat guy
 I thought
 Yeah
 he spoke Crow okay


 I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it
 See this little cat
 Little cat
 2I know
 that sounds like kit 2
 I don't wanna say kitten


 So she named everybody in the class except for
 About four people
 I think they asked for names
 Oh did they
 Hunh
 That's funny
 Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there
 Yeah
 I noticed on the
 on the case for the tape recorder too
 that it's all
 Look right here
 Just
 That's
 It's like ash
 Is it from
 that must be from the fires
 You know
 Maybe it is
 Uh
 Cause that one whole day
 from
 but look at your cigarettes
 Just sitting there
 On the way into r
 from Roundup
 yesterday morning
 And they were
 talking about the weather and they said
 how we
 In Roundup
 On the way from Roundup
 I was listening to the radio
 Yesterday morning
 And they were talking
 Unhunh2
 (H)2 Is that right
 And I guess just from the fires

 Uh
 day before yesterday
 It was
 the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up
 And it was early
 Real early
 that
 that wind was just hot
 And
 well the smoke all blew in
 And it was just dense
 Okay then
 it
 that
 s
 it just kinda blew the smoke in
 then it was real hazy
 you'd look at the sun
 It was just
 She said people were driving around with their lights on
 And the lights were
 they didn't look like they were
 it's just from the drought and the dust
 you know
 and the smoke in the air
 I've never seen anything like it
 And she said like
 the lights looked a greenish color
 Yeah
 It was a weird
 ugly
 ugly day
 Rana Lee's gonna have a baby by the way

 She had a brother that died from asthma too
 Seem like a lot of people

 Just in a matter of a year's time
 Really

 Her brother was like
 just right out of high school

 She probably really couldn't
 You know

 and she2 was always
 she's allergic to horsehair
 Oh
 Well XX
 Did she ever go to a allergy doctor
 or anybody like 2that2
 She t
 well they
 they should have gotten her
 I don't know why they didn't either
 I
 I w always wondered about that
 and she was s
 she had such severe asthma
 I would have done a little bit more for her I think
 If you wanna talk about somebody tired
 that girl couldn't walk down to the street and back
 And me and mom always accused her of being lazy
 You know
 HI all she did was sleep HI
 She sounded like she had more problems than
 she probably wasn't really lazy
 you know
 we like take everything for granted
 Then somebody like that
 every little breath is like and effort to em
 d

 Well Deb by got
 Debby got to the point
 you know every
 just
 really often she would go
 and her
 was just hard
 labored breathing all of her life
 She actually died of a heart attack
