(pause_medium) So you don't need to go (pause_medium) borrow equipment from anybody
to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) to do the feet
(pause_medium) Do the hooves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) something (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) So
Mae (pause_medium)
I'm gonna (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to do those
cause y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) n you just
(pause_medium) it takes (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and I'm not as good
as like somebody that would do it (pause_short) all the time
(pause_short) You know
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Oh (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) I'm not (uh) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know how to say it
(pause_medium) most people that you would get to trim your horse do it (pause_short) all the time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I'm not (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) that good or
(pause_short) and I'm not very strong
Did they train you (pause_medium)
Did they train you that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) yeah
(pause_short) So you have your own equipment
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_medium) Dad
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)(pause_short) of kinda how to do it
or (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) people come to our place
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) down there
(um)
you have to (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you have to take this class
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you can only take (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) if you wanna go on in it
you n (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And I decided to go ahead and go on in it
(pause_short) And the first part of it
(pause_short) is like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well we have lecture
(pause_short) then we have lab
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And like
(pause_short) we just go into the classroom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_medium) it (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) they go over
(pause_short) the whole
(pause_medium) the whole part (pause_short) of the horse
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) all the skeleton (pause_short) part of it you know
and (pause_medium)
and they go through (pause_short) every kinda ligament
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) millions of ligaments
and millions of (pause_short) tendons
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the bone in the hoof
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) then all the (pause_short) wall
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he went over on how to trim it
and where you (pause_medium)
and a horse (pause_short) has this little white line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you clean it out with the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) with the hoof knife
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then there (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and then you can see this little white line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that's kinda where you go by
to (pause_medium)
SM (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) has that (pause_short) little white line right the re
and that 's where you kinda SM (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)(vocal_noises_inhalation) kinda need a little guide
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) I am still scared to do it
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) By doing it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And make em
and they're just (pause_short) a little bit
for f (pause_medium)
I mean they're just (pause_short) sore
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's not bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they m (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) they have to
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) keep em (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) away from anything
(pause_short) no (pause_short) hard pebbles
or hard (pause_short) clods of dirt or anything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) ( Hx) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
I'm (pause_short) a little scared (pause_short) about doing it yet
(pause_short) When I get done with them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) SM A lot of times
and I'll look at (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and it's still
(pause_short) it's too (pause_short) long
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then like
(pause_medium) I would never
(pause_short) ever
(pause_short) ever
(pause_short) to shoe a horse
(pause_short) See we did that too
we did (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We did a lot of stuff
we did a lot of stuff with the (pause_medium)
(um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) the burners
and you'd put the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you'd have (pause_medium)
you started out with the straight (pause_short) iron
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you'd stick it into the
(pause_short) into the
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you'd put it into the hot SM (pause_short) coals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
we'd (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
and we'd make it a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We just put the shoes that were already made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And that's as far as we got
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well as a matter of fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is really funny
there isn't (pause_short) really (pause_short) any girl farriers (pause_short) around anywhere
They're really (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) th Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And the m (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the reason they were showing us this at college
(pause_short) to get us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to know if our trimmer
and shoer were_s (pause_short) doing it right
and (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments
(pause_short) we had it in another class too
we (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that was kind of a double thing that
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) we had in (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in another class
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well it was a review for some people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if it was a review or not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) (TSK) anyway
(um)
(pause_medium) PAR P what was I gonna say
(pause_short) I forgot what I was think (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) w um
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) when we put em on a horse's hoof
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're already made
(pause_short) they're round
(pause_short) we pick out a size
(pause_short) you know we'd
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is a double aught
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) this is
(pause_short) what s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and double aught and aught
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) are the (pause_short) ones that are most popular
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) For
(pause_medium) (TSK) you know
the (pause_medium)
that's a d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Or ponies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But we're talking just the regular
(pause_short) light horses you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
aught and aught (pause_medium)
(uh) aught
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well anyway
you go get your (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you go get your shoe
(pause_short) It's already made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) _You go look
every horse is gonna have (pause_short) a little (pause_short) different shape
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And so what you have to do
So every (pause_medium)
every (uh)
horseshoe is made (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No no
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
What (pause_medium)
then that's (pause_short) that's where the ferrier comes in
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Every shoe
(pause_short) you get order
You'd get (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The ferrier gets em
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And then
(pause_medium) (TSK) _Our job
(pause_short) to the horse's foot
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that
(pause_short) but it's really hard to do
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some of em you have to
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
say your shoe's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) like this
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and your horse's foot is just really wide or something
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well then you have to put it on the anvil
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well then once you stretch the shoe out
(pause_short) well then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the two corners
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You stretch this out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then you have to round these back
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it s it sounds easy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would never do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean we had to do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod
(pause_short) I mean
that's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) thirty bucks
for twenty horses (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(pause_medium) Jesus
that would be a th (pause_short) nine hundred dollars
(pause_medium) SM I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) w you know
(pause_medium) like
(pause_short) that have a lot of horses and stuff
(pause_short) and that they're riding a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) let the college kids do em
(pause_short) For em you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're taking the risk
(pause_short) of having their horse (pause_medium) get lame
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) It really never happens
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it's not like
(pause_short) there's a person that's just gung ho
(vocal_noises_inhalation) trims their feet
(pause_short) all the time I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he e (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) so it's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But (uh)
(pause_medium) P PAR What was I gonna say PAR P
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you get so (pause_medium)
I've (pause_medium) only done like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) well (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) at the end of the year
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) right now
(pause_short) only shod about
(pause_short) five horses
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Trimmed a lot of em
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know what we start out with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We start out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) with
(pause_short) dead horse hooves
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) The people that (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) kill the horses for meat and stuff
(pause_short) You know they have all these legs and stuff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't know
everybody (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
I thought they used the (THROAT) the horsehooves in (pause_short) for gelatin
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) HI You know
(pause_short) then they
(pause_short) they probably use em for everything (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
we (pause_short) (TSK) get (pause_short) these horse hooves
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) a long ways to go get em
to get these (pause_short) horse hooves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For the college
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They go back (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) East
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So we have this frozen horse hoof
cause you don't want to (pause_short) cripple up a (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) really good horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that horse would have been
(pause_short) lame
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) like crazy
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it was just
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit
(pause_short) they start really stinking and stuff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) HI I mean
you have this HI (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) piece of horse (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) HI I mean this leg that's (vocal_noises_laughter) HI
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And like in some of em
(pause_medium) (TSK) blood will spurt out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's nothing (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
SM (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's the grossest thing SM
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's why (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory
it's just the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But once you get into it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But
(pause_medium) I would have never got into that class
if (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's no way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I heard everybody saying (um) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) talking about
(pause_medium) VOX Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they stink VOX
I'm never (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then once I got into it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (TSK) at first it was kind of a bummer
(pause_medium) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm glad I took it
(pause_medium) Really glad
(pause_medium) (TSK) It pays off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) twelve bucks
(pause_medium) I mean that's twelve bucks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) with
(pause_short) a horse that I was really using a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that's still twelve dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) shoot
(pause_medium) But
anybody (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
(TSK) (pause_medium) I wanna wait until the morning
(pause_short) to do that
(pause_short) because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just
(pause_medium) too hot in the afternoon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean you can get
(pause_short) just
(pause_short) exhausted
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Anyway
I was gonna tell you about that (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the girl
there isn't mary (pause_short) very many
(pause_short) ferrier girls you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This summer I met one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Jorgensen's
they have (pause_medium) one (pause_short) shoer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I guess like in Minnesota it's real wet
(pause_short) and stuff you know
(pause_short) they really have to watch their shoes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's like
and they're not (pause_short) as dry or anything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When you get back here
we have to watch out for like (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) like the hooves being too dry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Not this time of the year
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) usually they're too wet
and that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that shoe can just pull right off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) the hoof wall is so soft
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
and I nei (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I didn't realize that in (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Sure it's gonna be softer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I never even thought about that until I took this class
So it's (pause_medium)
you know that's (pause_short) kinda stuff too that you think about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
(pause_medium) (TSK) they always have this one horseshoer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this girl's been (pause_short) in this ferrier
(pause_medium) (uh)
she's going to an actual (pause_short) ferrier college
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They have a lot of those around
(pause_short) a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she's going to one of em
(pause_short) like nine months
(pause_short) to this one
(uh)
(pause_short)(vocal_noises_inhalation) left to go
(pause_medium) What
(pause_medium) Guess I'll put it on
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she (pause_medium)
he's like taking her as a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) it's really different
you just (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) don't see that
(pause_medium) at all
(pause_short) ever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Jorgensen's have a (pause_medium) girl (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or a g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know a guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they
are (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's this girl
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) I couldn't believe it
(pause_medium) She's a tiny girl
she's got arms the size of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they're huge
but she must only (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) HI What is m (pause_medium) blowing out of there HI
it's just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) it gets dust accumulated in it
(pause_medium) It was just on last night
I (pause_medium)
It (pause_short) Mae Lynne
(pause_short) for one thing the (pause_short) filters are dirty because it (pause_short) it so (pause_medium)
(pause_short) been so dry
(pause_medium) And the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it all comes acrost
(pause_medium) the road
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) and then it builds up real bad with
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (COUGH) deposits
In other words I (pause_short) should be (pause_short) change filters
(pause_medium) God
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_medium) It won't last long
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) it sure does make a mess in the house
(pause_medium) Anyway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) She's out there just
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) working away
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) trim and trim and trim
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And shoe
(pause_short) for me (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) that's something I'm not used to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) HI it's HI tiring
(pause_medium) The very (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) at the very beginning
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then we moved up to two
(pause_short) Then we moved up to a full horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) We were just slowly got in shape
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But now if I went to do that
(pause_medium) I'd never be able to handle it
(pause_medium) It's just (pause_medium)
it's a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It is really hard work
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) You're bent over
and it's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
it takes (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) like (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) it's just hard hard work
It's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it doesn't seem like it would be
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) it is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Those (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It's hard
(pause_short) (TSK) I've never been kicked
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) most people's horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they
(pause_medium) they don't get by with stuff
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) horses at college
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's like a kid
(pause_medium) are ornery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And like
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) kinda be ornery about half way
but not (pause_medium) not too bad
(pause_medium) I've never been (pause_short) kicked doing it at all
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know
just had to learn (pause_medium) our safety of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) where to stand
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You have to stand like these certain ways
(pause_short) oh and it's a killer on your back
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You're standing (pause_medium)
((MICROPHONE))
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) You're standing like this you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And like
the horse's hoof (pause_medium) _lays like this right over you
(pause_short) like this working
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This is like a hoof knife
then a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And like in the front
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You stick the horse's hoof (pause_short) between your leg
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Kinda like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's really hard on your back
(pause_short) Like
(pause_short) I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous
(pause_medium) Couldn't believe it
(pause_medium) She had like on this (pause_short) really (pause_short) p kinda short shirt
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
There's this (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think that's cold
(pause_medium) Just don't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it's (pause_medium)
it's just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Makes a sound
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Nkay
(pause_medium) So what (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what were you gonna do out there today
What other (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what other things were you gonna (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Just go out and (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Look at the filly
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I think more or less (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) so late now
(pause_medium) Pretty much all we're gonna do is go out
(pause_short) I don't know what her plans really are
(pause_short) But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe go to that (pause_medium) seasonal dance
(pause_medium) Is that what it's called
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) I don't know what it's called either
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_medium) Doing what
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) The dance
(pause_short) How he said there's four guys
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Since there's four seasons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) He's a pretty neat guy
(pause_medium) I thought
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) Yeah
he spoke Crow okay (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) See this little cat (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Little cat (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I know
that sounds like kit (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) I don't wanna (vocal_noises_laughter) say kitten
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) So she named everybody in the class except for (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (TSK) About (pause_short) four people
(pause_short) I think they asked for names
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) Oh did they (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Hunh
(pause_medium) That's funny
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there
(pause_medium) Yeah
I noticed on the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) on the case for the tape recorder too
that it's all (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Look right here
(pause_short) Just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It's like ash
Is it from (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that must be from the fires
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) Maybe it is
(pause_medium) Uh (pause_medium)
Cause that one (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) whole day
(pause_short) from
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but look at your cigarettes
(pause_medium) Just sitting there
(pause_medium) On the way into r (pause_medium)
(pause_short) from (pause_short) Roundup
(pause_short) yesterday morning
(pause_medium) And they were
(pause_short) talking about the weather and they said
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) how we
(pause_medium) In Roundup
(pause_short) On the way from Roundup
(pause_short) I was listening to the radio
(pause_medium) Yesterday morning
(pause_medium) And they were talking (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Unhunh
(H) (pause_short) Is that right
(pause_medium) And I guess just from the fires
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) day before yesterday
(pause_medium) It was (um)
(pause_medium) the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up
(pause_medium) And it was early
(pause_short) Real early
that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that wind was just hot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) well the smoke all blew in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it was just (pause_short) dense
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay then
(pause_medium) it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that
(pause_short) s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it just kinda blew the smoke in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then it was real hazy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you'd look at the sun
(pause_short) It was just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) She said people were driving around with their lights on
And the lights were (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they didn't look like they were (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) it's just from the drought and the dust
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) and the smoke in the air
(pause_medium) I've never seen anything like it
(pause_short) And she said like
(pause_short) the lights looked (pause_short) a greenish color
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) It was a weird
(pause_short) ugly
(pause_short) ugly day
(pause_short) Rana Lee's gonna have a baby by the way
(pause_medium) Brian's (pause_short) wife
(pause_medium) I didn't even know she was pregnant
(pause_medium) Of course I guess they can get big in three months
(pause_short) I (pause_short) I told you
(pause_medium) Bran (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) F what's her name
(pause_short) Rana Lee
(pause_medium) Rana Lee F
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium) Rana Lee
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) I don't know why I told you that (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) SING Rana Lee SING
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She had a brother that died from asthma too
(pause_medium) Seem like a lot of people
(pause_medium) I mean that's weird
Why don't we (pause_short) go
just in (pause_medium)
except (pause_medium)
Just in a matter of a (pause_short) year's time
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Her brother was like
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) just right out of high school
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(pause_short) about Deb at all
(pause_short) She probably really couldn't
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
she was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she was in and out of the hospital
(pause_short) Who was that
(pause_short) Debby
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean she was in (pause_medium)
she (vocal_noises_inhalation) loved horses so much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she was always
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she's allergic to horsehair
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Well XX
(pause_medium) Did she ever go to a allergy doctor
(pause_short) or anybody like that
She (pause_short) t (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) well they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they should have gotten her (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know why they didn't either
I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I w always wondered about that
and she was s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) she had such severe asthma
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would have done a little bit more for her I think
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If you wanna talk about somebody tired
(pause_medium) that girl couldn't (pause_medium) walk down to the street and back
(pause_medium) And me and mom always accused her of being lazy
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) HI all she did was sleep HI
(pause_medium) She sounded like she had more problems than (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) she probably wasn't really (pause_medium) lazy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
we like take (pause_short) everything for granted
(pause_medium) Then somebody like that
(pause_medium) every little breath is like (pause_short) and effort to em
d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Well Deb by got (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Debby got to the point
(pause_medium) you know every (pause_medium)
(pause_short) just
(pause_short) really often she would go (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) and her
(pause_short) was just hard
(vocal_noises_inhalation) labored breathing all of her life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) She actually died of a heart attack
(pause_medium) They did have an autopsy done on her
(pause_medium) It surprised me
(pause_medium) But they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And it was actually a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) One side of her heart was just hard
(pause_medium) the muscle (pause_medium)
from just (pause_short) labored breathing
(pause_medium) That's just sick
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) we didn't realize what she was going through
(pause_medium) And you know (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) maybe that's another reason why she didn't really (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff
(pause_medium) pay that much attention to Amanda
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean it seems like she'd pay more attention to her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) last forever for her
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_medium) well if I go
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) It's just too bad
(pause_medium) I just hope Orville and Genetta get that little girl
there's no (pause_medium)
They can't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They want her three months out of the year
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) there's not much they can do
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) This is the type of person
(pause_medium) that (pause_medium) is like (pause_medium) a hermit
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) I don't know what you'd call him (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
Well they were (pause_short) rai (pause_short) raised (pause_medium) backward
He's like (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) back woods
(pause_short) Back woodsy
didn't d (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Never came down out of the mountains
(pause_short) He doesn't have any (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He doesn't know what's going on in this world
(pause_short) No he doesn't
(pause_short) He was just not properly brought up
He (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) I forget
(pause_medium) Um Macley
(pause_medium) Arco
(pause_medium) Isn't that where Deb (pause_short) kinda was
(pause_medium) But he's just really really really strange
I can't imagine teaching a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Who suggested this to em
It was probably my (pause_short) sister in law's idea because
(pause_medium) I think they saw (pause_medium) that movie
(pause_medium) Tap
X (pause_medium)
They had (pause_medium)
the movie with that (pause_short) really hot tap danc er
(pause_medium) He was actually here two weeks ago
at the (pause_short) at the jazz (pause_short) t ap thing or whatever
(H) No he's like (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah he's a teenager
(pause_short) he's supposed to be awe some
(pause_medium) Really fa st
(pause_medium) But I'm sure that was the (pause_short) the impetus
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) You (pause_short) you probably read the same Examiner article I read
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) he's teaching these classes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he k (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He does n't explain anything precisely
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Prob ably XX XXX (pause_medium)
I mean he has a bro (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) I guess that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff
(pause_medium) He healed very quickly
just like (pause_short) grow back really fast (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Th that's it
(pause_short) little kids usually don't break their legs anyway
(pause_short) Cause they're so XXX
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) aren't their k (pause_short) legs pretty soft
there's less calcium (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) deposits in them
(pause_medium) And also
(pause_short) they're still growing
(pause_medium) And the way (pause_medium) bones grow is
(pause_short) you make cartilage
(pause_short) and then you deposit calcium in it
So that's why they always have (pause_medium) more flexibility
(pause_medium) you're making cartilage
So it al (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in which case
(pause_medium) They get old and cranky like the rest of us
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) Old and rickety and brittle
(pause_short) Mhm
uncoordinated and (pause_short) unflexible
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) Stiff
(pause_medium) That too
(pause_medium) What are you planning on doing with dancing
(pause_medium) You were taking some classes last fall
(pause_short) I'll take a few more
as a (pause_medium)

Cause I feel like I'm hearing (pause_medium)
(pause_short) We have (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
These are the shittiest (pause_short) speakers on earth

(pause_medium) You think we have like a jazz band next door
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) is there somebody downstairs
(pause_short) playing
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) It's our garage band
when (pause_short) when the jazz came on
(pause_medium) As compared to the other stuff
or kind of (pause_short) coming in from some place
(pause_medium) Usually we just have really loud salsa parties across the street
(pause_medium) And teenagers
(pause_short) kissing each other on the side walk
(pause_medium) And little kids throwing paint in your backyard
(pause_medium) (GROWL)

(pause_medium) Yep
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(H)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(pause_short) Uh oh
(pause_short) i (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well you see their eyeballs
(pause_short) Yeah the other (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But the thing is
Do you know those (pause_medium)
(pause_short) any of those dances
(pause_medium) The little what
(pause_medium) Looks like
(pause_short) the second
(pause_medium) What's an Oba Oba skit
(pause_medium) I never saw that
Look like (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) a real (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's pretty good
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
With the right (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) This isn't from Africa
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) From Indonesia
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) But that person looks Black
(pause_medium) Which one is it
The (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I figure the second one from the to p
(pause_medium) Hunh
(pause_medium) That's interesting
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) cause I think Indo Indonesians
think (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) people who've been to Indonesia
(pause_short) think that those guys
(pause_medium) have really European characteristics
(pause_medium) compared to Indonesians
(pause_medium) Just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big
(pause_medium) Oh really
(pause_medium) and flat noses and stuff
(pause_medium) P I don't know P
(pause_medium) Except those
(pause_short) well
(pause_medium) I don't know
the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the bottom ones don't have flat noses either
That's true they all have b (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But they get bigger as you go up anyway
(pause_medium) Their mustaches
(pause_medium) Is it the (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the way their little beard goes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I d (pause_medium)
He looks like (pause_short) that guy
(pause_medium) Poor guy
(pause_short) That is really interesting
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Cause I remember
(pause_short) 's kinda funny
(pause_medium) Well the top guy has a real thick lip
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
He didn't (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
Then he tried to (pause_medium)
He danced with (pause_medium) a friend of mine
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) boy
(pause_short) Oo
Oba (pause_short) Oba
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) But I'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women
(pause_short) I'm sure a lot of women throw themselves at em
(pause_medium) A lot of groupies
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Fringe benefits
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) The only fringe benefit of being a dancer
(pause_short) Well in San Francisco
(pause_short) you never know if it's a benefit or not
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I didn't know this
but apparently in (pause_short) Brazil
It's supposed to be (pause_short) very high
(pause_medium) You mean like
higher than the United State (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Higher than around here
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_short) P I wouldn't be surprised P
(um)
(pause_medium) it's something like forty percent of males
in (pause_short) the Bay Area
(pause_short) this is what (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) this doesn't seem like it can be true
(pause_medium) ninety per cent of gay men
(pause_medium) are HIV positive
(pause_medium) and fifty percent of all males
(pause_medium) are HIV positive
(pause_short) Fifty perc (pause_medium)
It was some (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Like
(pause_short) a m (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it was (pause_short) fairly young men
(pause_medium) but
It wasn't necessarily that they were (pause_medium) infected
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Well
(pause_medium) it's the same difference
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease
(pause_medium) But that's what she said
(pause_short) Now I don't know if she meant the Bay area or San Francisco
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but those are some ferocious numbers
(pause_medium) you meet
(pause_short) yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
cause there're a lot of women out there who (pause_short) apparently don't believe in using condoms
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) I'm just amazed
in (pause_short) t's mainly urban areas
that had this really (pause_medium) disproportionately high (pause_short) propor (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) percentage
(pause_short) r rural areas
(pause_short) had like (pause_medium) ten percent or less
(pause_medium) of the males
(pause_short) had been infected
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I would assume San Francisco is higher than most cities around the country
(pause_medium) that just blew me away
(pause_short) Cause I'm thinking well gee
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) and just talking with guys
(pause_medium) in their twenties
(pause_medium) I mean these guys
(pause_medium) say these women don't care if they use rubbers or not
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) with all the information available
Right yeah (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That's really scary
(pause_short) So I guess it's time for me to become a priest
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
This (pause_medium) woman I knew I was gonna ask out
(pause_short) BR God BR
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) was telling me how her sister just won't use rubbers
(pause_medium) HI at all HI
(pause_short) Well where would she put them
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) I mean
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) what are they thinking
(pause_short) P (TSK) I don't know P
(pause_medium) Don't look at me
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I I was just really amazed to hear that
(pause_short) We don't have sex
you would (pause_short) know better
(pause_short) And in high school
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) Something's (vocal_noises_exhalation) wrong (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I thought we got our electricity fixed
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
It's been doing (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh
But (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) What what (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Who is this
(pause_medium) I don't know
it's from the radio station years ago when I was (pause_medium) in Santa Cruz
(pause_medium) You know on Sundays
(pause_medium) at ten o'clock
(pause_medium) That's right now
(pause_short) what is that
(pause_medium) oh I don't know what the radio station is
they played this (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know what it was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But it was like I went to Bahia
What's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) last Sunday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) got there at eight
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) left a ten
(pause_medium) dropped this person off at home
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I was noticing
(pause_short) the songs they were playing on the radio
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_short) should I turn on the radio statio (pause_medium)
I I was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) P KKSF
(pause_short) does that mean anything to you P
(pause_medium) Nope
(pause_medium) You have to translate it to a number
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
But (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was just remembering being surprised
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't realize
(pause_short) I don't know anything about Brazilian music
You go to the (pause_short) Brazilian club
and they're singing (pause_short) songs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) apparently I guess that's the popular stuff
(pause_short) I guess
(pause_medium) I'm so used to hearing those songs
(pause_short) I didn't think anything of it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this guy played songs for a whole hour
(vocal_noises_inhalation) eighty per cent of those songs I'd (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that band had sung that very night
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) Pickup band's pretty good there
(pause_medium) Vi va (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_medium) Friday night
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) The dance floor's too small in that place though
(pause_short) It's really annoying
(pause_medium) P (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I like this song (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) P
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Are they (pause_medium) teaching (pause_medium) any more lambada
(pause_medium) at (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) school
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Vivian was giving a lambada lesson
Cause (uh)
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_medium) XX (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So I can learn how to beat my hips
(vocal_noises_inhalation) cause their (pause_short) their hips are SLAPPING beating up against you
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Hundred cycles per second
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(H)
(pause_short) It (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(H)
And the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) only way to learn how is to dance with them mo re
(pause_medium) But (uh)
(pause_medium) No th (pause_medium)
I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) They haven't done anything recently
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I
(pause_short) like
(pause_medium) May and June
(pause_medium) and (uh)
Is she a good (pause_short) lambada dancer
I can't imagine her being a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah but
I didn't feel like she taught it any different (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) significantly differently than when Vivian and Jeff taught it
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) cause they do it
(pause_short) and real simple
(pause_short) than Brazilians do it
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) I don't know what those Brazilian women are doing
(pause_short) What are they do ing
Are they going (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) really fast
(pause_short) I mean are they going one two three
(pause_medium) and then
(pause_medium) it's like
(pause_medium) SLAPPING they're (pause_short) coming
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_medium) I don't even know how you can do that
(pause_short) You're dancing with them
(pause_medium) SLAPPING
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
using their (pause_short) pelvic bones
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) but anyway
(pause_short) But that's what I want to learn
Don't (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) don't they teach you to go
(pause_short) one two three
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Or do they go like really fast like that
It was just Jeff and (pause_medium)
(pause_short) sure
but that's cause it's for s (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) it seems to me if they're gonna teach it like what you do
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Or what they teach
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_medium) hm
do it like that (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I should (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I like that
(pause_medium) P P (pause_medium)
I mean after I f (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I mean I (pause_medium)
Are you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) night
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) In fact I would have gone today
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Well I finally found some people there I can dance with
(pause_short) So that helps
(pause_medium) To go there
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) Besides
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) If (pause_medium)
(pause_short) If you're a woman
(pause_medium) I swear it
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (SNIFF) (pause_short) You could come too
(H) Well I don't necessarily (pause_medium) mean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) in a bad way
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I'm not dancing with guys
(pause_short) All I can say is
(pause_medium) Da rn
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) it's kind of funny (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) So she's just gonna watch
(vocal_noises_inhalation) every once in a while I'd get up and dance
(pause_medium) and it's like
(pause_medium) when I'd come back
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe Harold you should come with me
(pause_medium) Why
(pause_medium) So I can find (pause_medium)
(pause_short) learn some lam (pause_short) lambada
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) find some girls with empty chairs next to em
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Maybe I should go with Miles
(pause_short) Oh did (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
did (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) What
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) told you that story about that woman
(pause_medium) who (uh)
(pause_medium) I was there Sunday three (pause_short) four weeks ago
(pause_medium) Uh
after the class is over w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) over with
(pause_medium) I'm sitting down at a table
there's a woman from (pause_medium)
(pause_short) who was in the class
(pause_medium) sitting to my right
(pause_short) is a table with two women there
(pause_short) They had apparently just come from Oba Oba
(pause_medium) on the last night
(pause_medium) And like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Anyway
(pause_short) out there dancing
(pause_medium) BR by himself BR
(pause_medium) And the woman was just looking at him
(pause_medium) in front of him
(pause_medium) in this skirt that's this short
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) takes her hands
(pause_short) and goes along his toes
and is just (pause_short) doing like that
(pause_short) I figured
(pause_medium) Oo
(pause_short) very well
(vocal_noises_laughter) in fact (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Gross
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) they did that for the whole dance
(pause_short) people would like (pause_medium) cheering
(pause_short) Q go for it Q
And all this kind of (pause_medium) HI thing HI
(pause_short) The (pause_short) the song ended
(pause_short) the guy set down
(pause_short) at another table
(pause_short) And she (pause_short) set down
(pause_medium) at a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) This is like
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
this woman's sitting (pause_medium) about as far away from me as Jamie is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was thinking
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her
(pause_medium) No sooner did I think this thought
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) What
(pause_short) you didn't ask her to dance
(pause_medium) Not Miles
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) why wasn't he sitting at her table
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) You mean
you were still thinking about it (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) this guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) I mean he comes over there
(pause_short) immediately afterwards
the same guy who got his (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the same guy who's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) who was like sitting about where you are
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) He was sitting there
(pause_short) And then these two women are sitting here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (uh)
(pause_short) I don't know about what
(pause_medium) she and her friend are over at their table
(pause_medium) And then
(pause_medium) twenty minutes later
they were kinda like (pause_short) all over each other
(pause_medium) kissing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was thinking
(pause_short) these people aren't going home alone tonight
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Go sh
But I just thought that (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) Oh my God (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) maybe I shouldn't go there then
(pause_medium) Yeah
maybe you shouldn't (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_short) I went there before
(pause_short) it was really fun
(pause_short) I went out there before
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) Without telling me
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You knew
(pause_short) If I was going out dancing
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) I did
(pause_short) every now and then
(pause_medium) Well the thing that gets me
(pause_medium) I meet this (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (CLICK) (CLICK) (CLICK) (pause_short) I meet this psychotherapist
(pause_medium) who tells me she's addicted to this dance
which I th (pause_medium)
think is a (pause_medium) interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But (uh)
(pause_medium) she's married
and apparently she's there (pause_short) without her husband
(pause_medium) She has her wedding ring on
(pause_medium) And it's like she's with this guy
and they're kinda like all over each other (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) And I'm thinking
(pause_medium) I guess that's her husband
(pause_short) Uh oh did you say something
but I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but the thing is
(pause_medium) you know she's kind of all sophisticated and everything
this guy (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I can't (pause_short) really believe that guy's her husband
(pause_medium) And of course later on I find out
(pause_short) that's not her husband
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) HI So
you know HI (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) bizarre
(pause_medium) But then she tells me
(pause_short) gee I don't know what it is about this guy I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I've been trying to tell him I don't want a sexual relationship with him
(pause_medium) from the way they look
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
you don't do that with (pause_medium)
So (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) To other people I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Well
I mean maybe (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That was actually very profound
(vocal_noises_laughter) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) that was (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
You (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) something'll land in your mouth
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)

He must have been (pause_medium)
(pause_short) HI that must have been quite a shock HI

Well I probably (vocal_noises_laughter) could've bought it that way (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
But I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) I said

it has n (pause_medium)
(pause_short) basically no body bones except a spine
to con (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) vey the nerves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is like some kind of horrific nightmare
This (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) That is the worst (vocal_noises_laughter)
I (pause_medium)
And it's just (pause_short) awful
(pause_medium) Course
(pause_short) You know
(pause_short) the early man probably said (pause_medium) the same thing about the first domestic chicken

(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) it'll be unpotent in a minute
(pause_medium) Not to worry
(pause_medium) Let me see
(pause_medium) What was I in here for

(pause_medium) In a fit of (pause_medium) household efficiency
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) okay
(pause_medium) One egg will do
(pause_medium) So my mom didn't catch any fish
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) Up north she said
(pause_medium) Rotten luck
(pause_short) Like in lakes
(pause_short) Um
(um)
(pause_short) on the coast of Or egon
(pause_short) Oh my
(pause_medium) Oops
(pause_short) Too late
(pause_medium) They have some (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So like what are they catching
(pause_short) Unh hunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And some guy who (pause_medium)
(pause_short) who knows a good thing when he's on to it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) calls them up
(pause_medium) I see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) And says
(pause_short) (TSK) VOX oh
(pause_short) The fish are running
and blah blah blah b VOX (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Catch fabulous salmon
(pause_medium) And they have it canned
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) when they're up there
(pause_short) and I guess they have some frozen
(pause_short) (TSK) VOX put it in our stockings
(pause_short) Isn't that great
(pause_medium) It's (pause_medium) nice for them
(pause_medium) But no salmon in your stockings this year
Spend their va (pause_medium)
they (vocal_noises_exhalation) have already done it (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) this was
(pause_medium) another trip
they were supposed to go up in (um)
(pause_medium) more
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) environmental thing
They were supposed to go up (pause_medium) at the end of (pause_medium) August
(pause_medium) When (pause_short) they usually run
(pause_medium)(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX fish weren't running this year VOX
(pause_short) Nothing's doing what it's supposed to
(pause_short) anymore
(pause_short) anywhere
(pause_medium) That's why that whole (pause_medium) mountain climbing (pause_short) expedition was screwy
What (pause_short) mountain climbing expedition was that
XX (pause_medium)
The one that we were (pause_short) part of
The (pause_short) ex pedition we went on in Nepal
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) Supposed to be perfect weather
right in between the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And they ended up getting (pause_short) early (pause_short) winter (pause_short) storms
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) Everywhere (pause_short) we've been
(pause_medium) in the past several years
(pause_short) everybody's talking about how
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the weather just (pause_short) isn't (pause_short) normal
(pause_medium) That's definitely been the case in Indonesia
(pause_short) Really
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Well like
when I was (pause_short) living there for the couple of years
(pause_short) it was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the rainy season was all off
(pause_short) you know
and was (pause_short) dry during the rainy season
(pause_medium) Gee
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) I mean (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I I don't know if our drought here will ever break
(pause_short) This is it
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_medium) Well they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they claim that there's these cycles
and that we're in the (pause_short) the middle of a normal cycle
(pause_short) I don't know how true that is
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) Thanks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I r I really (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) We read this great book
(pause_short) Called
(pause_medium) The End of Nature
(pause_short) Ew
(vocal_noises_laughter) Sounds wonderful
(pause_short) this
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) Harvard guy
(pause_short) a la Thor eau
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) anyway
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's called
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) and it's just really a scary book
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There's (vocal_noises_inhalation) no natural world left
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) His premise is basic ally this
(pause_medium) That
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) as soon as the world hit a point
(pause_medium) where (pause_medium) there was no more (pause_medium) objectively pristine (pause_short) land
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) When
(pause_medium) they found pollution on top of Mount Everest
(pause_medium) and at the very bottom of the ocean
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) FOOD Well
(pause_short) Mhm
Man has had (pause_short) some effect
(pause_medium) On the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) So in principle
(pause_medium) the concept of nature
(pause_short) is over
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) And then
(pause_short) in practice
(pause_short) since then
(pause_short) mhm
(pause_medium) MRC man has had such MRC dramatic impact
(pause_short) on (pause_medium) what we used to think of as nature
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) that the only way to coexist with nature (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) nature
(pause_short) the quasi religious
(pause_short) overarching
in side of which (pause_short) mankind lives
and (uh)
(pause_medium) w (pause_short) a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force
(pause_short) over and above ourselves
(pause_short) to order the universe
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Which just doesn't sound like a very practical (pause_medium) proposal
(pause_medium) Wow
(pause_medium) You know
the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in (pause_short) Europe and America
(pause_short) And the dodo
(pause_medium) main taining what's there
(pause_short) for the rest of time
(pause_medium) Not likely
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) that was his (pause_short) basic premise
Then it gets really depressing (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) new age
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) of how it might (pause_short) not (pause_short) be that way
(pause_medium) FOOD You know
(pause_short) so
(pause_medium) forget it
(pause_short) forget it
(pause_short) forget it
(pause_medium) We're fucked FOOD
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) Well I read it in the New Yorker
(pause_short) yuck Q
And I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It was really (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I read the whole thing
which is pretty rare (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Well my my
(pause_short) So I mean
(pause_short) but his premise is not that mankind can't (pause_short) survive on Earth
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) His ques tion is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in (pause_short) a (pause_medium) metaphysical world
that man is the highest (pause_medium) active (pause_medium) principle
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) Outside of
(pause_medium) completely faith based belief in God
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) irrespective of any (pause_short) relationship to nature
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) there is now
(pause_short) in the world
(pause_medium) to which we are beholden
(pause_medium) And he w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Sort of fucks up the animists
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
of (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Do we even want this
(pause_medium) Unhunh
(pause_medium) Well he is kind of saying its too late
(pause_short) He's saying
(pause_short) and we haven't even thought about
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) This is typical
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) And (pause_medium)
and then it gets down to s (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you know
the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) w it's all fine and good for us in this ge neration
Did (pause_medium)
(pause_short) did you want them broken smaller
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) VOX Yeah VOX
or saving (uh) (pause_medium) the (pause_short) polar bea r

(pause_medium) you (pause_medium)
Did you (pause_medium)

(pause_short) That has all this gold stuff
(pause_medium) not made out of gold
just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) I mean
it's this (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Or do you like (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Should they go somewhere
where they (pause_short) they (pause_short) recycle
(pause_short) turn in to compost
(pause_short) we don't have a com post pile yet
(pause_short) Which is where
(vocal_noises_inhalation)(pause_short) Garbage is underneath
(pause_short) If you can save the bag
(pause_short) you can (pause_short) turn it inside out and save it

(pause_medium) you don't have to
(pause_medium) this is (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I'll put these on the dining room table
(pause_short) XXX

Which has Indonesian and Philippine (pause_short) architecture in it
(pause_short) I don't know if you've seen either of those
(pause_medium) No
(pause_medium) These p (pause_medium)

(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) Uh
(pause_short) with
(pause_short) with
(pause_medium) mostly Batak and Dayak and
(pause_short) stuff
you can (pause_short) imagine
(pause_medium) pretty clearly
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium) Anyway
(pause_short) interesting
(pause_medium) That looks like enough salad
(pause_medium) Oh I get it
(pause_medium) Mar went out to put the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You put the water on the (pause_short) plants
(pause_short) Is that what was going on
(pause_medium) What
(pause_short) You were watering with that
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) that's good
(pause_medium) actually
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) but
(pause_medium) It's illegal
(pause_short) Really
(pause_short) How rude
(pause_medium) Isn't that retarded
(pause_medium) It is
(pause_medium) They just built a (pause_short) a great big gray water processing center
(pause_short) at the laundromat
(pause_short) in the (pause_short) complex where I live
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) There's all these huge machines and stuff
Great m (pause_medium)
that like (pause_short) filter it and all
and then it (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) They're going to like
(pause_short) pump it into their (pause_short) watering system
for the (pause_medium) apartment complex
(pause_medium) I mean you get your own
(pause_short) You don (pause_medium)
It's not like a (pause_short) big system some where
(pause_short) Yeah
But this is like (pause_medium)
but (pause_short) it's a (pause_short) complex
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) Cause
(pause_short) this is this apartment complex
and there's the (pause_short) laundromat
(pause_short) and they just (pause_medium) dump the water
(pause_medium) from that and everything
(pause_short) FOOD Well laundry's the best way
(pause_short) I guess FOOD
(pause_medium) The best way
(pause_short) To get gray water
(pause_short) think what might go down in the sink and stuff
(pause_medium) You wouldn't want to what
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) I guess
(pause_short) I guess it's more
that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It's not that you don't want it on your lawn
(pause_short) Before it goes on your lawn
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) Stuff from (pause_medium) the sink
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Cause the stuff from the sink
would be great (pause_medium) for your lawn
(pause_short) Yeah
sort of (pause_short) decomposing
instead of in a nice little (pause_short) compost pile
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_medium) you know
if you (pause_medium)
if you (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) if you didn't have
(pause_medium) if you were really careful about your dishes
and it was just (pause_short) runoff
(pause_short) Well that would be good
(pause_medium) Cause all of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with
But (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Mister Samuel (pause_short) had like

I remember the (pause_medium)
the students (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I saw Sally Samuel
who is (pause_short) pregnant
and has about (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) Let's not discuss it

(vocal_noises_inhalation) how's your father Q

(pause_short) Eli's parents probably tried to get him transfered out of his class
(pause_short) And that was the on ly way to do it
(pause_medium) Definitely insa ne
(vocal_noises_exhalation) Hey Coop

(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you have them work as a team
so that the (vocal_noises_inhalation) fourth grader can help the third grader Q
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But (pause_short) that's bullshit
(pause_short) Because
(pause_medium) that just teaches the third grader
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that he's worthless
(pause_short) No it's not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) how many third graders do (pause_medium)

As long as it's (pause_medium)
Part of your (pause_medium)
(THROAT) corp orate (pause_medium)

(vocal_noises_inhalation) don't give away (pause_medium)
because you're d (vocal_noises_inhalation) denying them of (pause_short) learning
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) If y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they get it and they kind of go
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It shouldn't be (pause_medium) multiple choice
(pause_medium) (TSK) It isn't
(pause_short) They should (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They should have to
(pause_medium) Like
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) give them something to work on that there is no answer to
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But the other fourth graders it's like
they don't really wan (pause_medium)
they don't (pause_short) want to help the kids
they (pause_medium)
They wa (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they get u ps et with me

(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
and these (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The thing is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that the teachers that had these third graders before
Cause they didn't (pause_short) teach them (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) didd ly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) In the (pause_short) in the second grade I learned my times tables
In the third grade I knew th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I failed
These kids (pause_short) can't do their times table s
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The fourth graders even

(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) hey

(pause_short) like fifth grade
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) Well were (pause_medium)
I could not (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I could not do fractions
(pause_short) And I mean with (pause_short) Samuel as a teacher
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) who wants to go up (vocal_noises_laughter) to this man and say (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (GASP)
(pause_medium) Oh
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) my whole fourth grade year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And then there was a (pause_medium) VOX possibility VOX the following year
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Cause our (vocal_noises_laughter) fifth grade tea cher (vocal_noises_laughter) was leaving

(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
We just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) man
(pause_medium) the first granola woman I ever met
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter) Granola wo man (vocal_noises_laughter)
(SIGH)
(pause_short) She would say
(vocal_noises_inhalation) ((CLAP)) VOX Let's go on a field trip
(pause_medium) We're gonna go on a hike VOX
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) but to try and (pause_short) and talk me out of believing in Murphy's Law
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
But I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) (TSK) Hardly
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) this chapter on heaven an hell
(pause_medium) Why
(pause_short) sort of
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) standard line
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) there were two things I got out of (pause_short) my marriage
and one was a (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) a child
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) That
(pause_medium) really got me grounded
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the fact of the matter is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that the marriage itself
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) it's like it pulled me under
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) giant shark
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it pulled me all the way under
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and there I was
(pause_short) then I found that (pause_short) I was on my own two feet again
And it really was (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK)
S what was hell in that (pause_short) that marriage became
(pause_medium) became a way out for me
(pause_medium) It was the flip side
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) It's like sometimes you go through things
(pause_medium) and you come out the other side of them
WH you WH (pause_short) come out so much better
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And if I hadn't had that
if I hadn't had (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) What do you mean
(pause_medium)(vocal_noises_inhalation) What goes in one way
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) doesn't come out XXX (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) Kay (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) So what did that have to d o (pause_medium)
But it's so good_ god (pause_medium)
What did (pause_medium)
It's it's ma (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) major league
(pause_short) What does that have to do with heaven and hell in the book
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I'm just sort of reiterating
(pause_medium) I could read you some
(pause_medium) No I I don't want to hear anything out of a book with
(pause_short) chapter called heaven and hell
(pause_short) No
(TSK) (pause_medium) Oh dear
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_short) I didn't like the book
the way I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You didn't
(pause_medium) That's because I have my own ideas about it
That I'm (pause_short) pretty comfortable with
(pause_medium) ah
(pause_medium) I don't like re (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And I
(pause_short) consider myself a real free thinker when it comes to that stuff
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
And that's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Remember
remember it in the movie (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) n they just become handbooks
(pause_medium) P No P
(pause_medium) no
(pause_short) no I don't
(pause_short) I don't
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I
(pause_medium) I come up with my own ideas about that stuff
(pause_medium) And where do you get the ideas
(pause_medium) Thought
(pause_medium) And where do you get those thoughts
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) Isn't a book part of what goes on around you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) more from an oblique source
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) or articles
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but (pause_short) but
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That someone's written about death
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Well (pause_medium)
What (pause_medium)
d (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
what what this man has put in the boo (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I haven't read the book so I don't know
but (vocal_noises_inhalation)
d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from the Zen and
(pause_short) f it just pools on other different (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) different sources
Well F it (pause_short) might all be bullshit F
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Th th the things I know most
about life and death come from (pause_short) from (pause_short) my grandmother
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And having gone through all that (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) With her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then it was interesting
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For two months
(vocal_noises_inhalation) About (pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she had this dream of falling off a building
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Down o (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Just like that
(pause_short) that cartoon we saw
(pause_medium) Falling
(pause_short) Yeah
yeah (pause_short) yeah (pause_short) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it was like that
(pause_medium) And then she said that she dreamt about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_short) all of her relatives
(pause_medium) that had died
(pause_medium) She wasn't dreaming about anybody who was living
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) And I read that later
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) people who (pause_short) had (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) technically died
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Saw (pause_short) relatives coming for them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Course that may be what happens
(pause_short) prior to the big
(pause_medium) the big nothing
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So why are you reading a book about dying
(pause_medium) P I don't know P
(pause_short) you don't know
(pause_short) I have an interest in it
(pause_medium) You're alive
(pause_medium) I've always been interested in it
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) W Why W
(pause_medium) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) With
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) with (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) and Bette Davis
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I couldn't believe
(vocal_noises_inhalation)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) I wanna say windbags
(pause_medium) Ha but what happens to them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) here's Betty Davis
(vocal_noises_laughter) z yeah (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This incredible (pause_medium) film legend
(pause_medium) And we think of her in Jezebel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
smoking (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) cigarette smoke into the faces of (pause_short) William Holden and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the like
(pause_medium) (TSK) You've never seen Betty Davis movie
You've heard Kim (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) The song Betty Davis Eyes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And she's got
And so she (pause_short) she lives
I n (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) What does that have to do with why you're reading a book on death
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I've always been interested in death
(pause_medium) F Why F
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
WH (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) yeah I'm laughing
What is (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm thinking one thing my mother always used to say
(vocal_noises_laughter) Pamela
you are (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
you are (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q you'll be sorry when we're dead Q
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) Mm
So i w it's it's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I h (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you said to Deven
And then we went to the Chalk (pause_short) Fair
(pause_short) unhunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he took off with Tobias
(pause_medium) Is that
(pause_short) that (pause_short) I wanted to say with him well your dad wanted to spend time with you today
(pause_medium) And why did you run off
(pause_medium) (TSK) And I didn't
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that my mother tried to guilt me the same way
(pause_medium) So that's why you're interested in death
(pause_medium) (TSK) (TSK) Maybe it's because my parents were old
(pause_medium) I've always
(pause_medium) thought it's weird
that we've been (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I look down at my body
(pause_medium) And I feel like I'm in a spaceship
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
WH (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(vocal_noises_inhalation) n and
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) inside of some woman's womb
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I was (pause_medium) burped out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) trying to figure out what hap pens there
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) n n (pause_medium)
Maybe I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) May (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) No no no
I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) maybe this whole lifetime was just a really rude interruption
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) of what (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) Of what ever it was (vocal_noises_laughter) I was doing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) before my number came up
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was told I had to come back here
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What if
What (pause_short) if
(vocal_noises_exhalation) Unhunh
(pause_medium) gotten in the way
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Instead of just worrying about
(pause_medium) and making the best out of it
(pause_medium) Being here is
(pause_short) is so illusive sometimes
(pause_medium) I mean (pause_short) illusionary
(pause_medium) Those are two different words
(pause_medium) I take back what I said about illusive
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
Y (pause_short) you may be elusive

(pause_medium) well
yeah but (pause_short) but (pause_short) but
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) to me the whole point is is
(pause_medium) you have no idea
(pause_medium) You have no idea
(pause_medium) You can read books about it
and you can (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) talk about it
(pause_medium) but the most pragmatic thing to do is
to just (pause_medium) live it
(pause_medium) Hm

(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) Yeah
sometimes I have to be real prep (pause_medium)
(pause_short) What
(pause_short) mom
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) I said a for real Santa Claus
you mean a man who lives (pause_short) at the north pole
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She said yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And she said
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they represent Santa Claus
They (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're a picture of Santa Claus
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're pictures of Santa Claus
(pause_medium) Is my mike on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It sure is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) and then she said well
(pause_medium) And I kind of
(pause_medium) love fills the stockings
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) She said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she said
(pause_medium) adults
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Adults who wanna show you how much they care
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) yeah
(pause_medium) Fill those stockings
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said
(pause_short) they wanna believe in Santa Claus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's what I told her
(pause_short) In fact sometimes I do believe in Santa Claus
(pause_medium) And that
(pause_medium) that really satisfied her
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) F But I thought it was very pragmatic of her to ask about that in June F
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I thought to myself
(pause_medium) WH (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) we were talking about
(pause_short) death and illusions
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I
(pause_medium) was paradox
(pause_medium) Why
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because
(pause_medium) I thought
(pause_short) any word
(pause_medium) that was defined
(pause_short) I mean I remember the definition
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That I learned in seventh grade
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That was paradox
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Seemingly contrary
(pause_medium) (TSK) Seemingly P P
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I had a hard time with the definition
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So I thought (pause_short) God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A word
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) That I'm supposed to learn
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I get this definition
(pause_medium) Chew on this one
(pause_medium) Is that redundant
(vocal_noises_laughter) (GROAN) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (GROAN) WH (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) that was age twelve
(pause_short) So (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I sort of
(pause_short) bit my teeth into that one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) From
(pause_short) from twelve to seventeen
(pause_medium) that went from paradox
(pause_medium) to
(pause_medium) the invisible
(pause_short) interfacing with the visible
(pause_medium) (TSK) Hunh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) inter facing with the visible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For everything you see

(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) That's (pause_medium) invisible
(pause_medium) It's not
(pause_medium) it's it's n
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what if
what if you took the same (pause_medium) spacesuit
(pause_medium) And you put another spirit into it
(pause_medium) It would be a different person
(vocal_noises_laughter) It'd say
let me out (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) a different person
(pause_medium) You're right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (pause_short) I
(pause_short) I
(pause_medium) I think it's
(H) it's very interesti (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) with who's inside of it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean you don't know that
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Wouldn't that be f a fascinating experiment
(pause_short) Genes
(pause_short) Genetic makeup
(pause_short) It's proven
(pause_short) And that's part of the spacesuit
(pause_medium) That that your genetic makeup
(pause_short) largely determines who you are
(pause_short) You mean (pause_short) the chemical bath I sit in
(pause_medium) As it were
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_short) Sort of dictates how I feel about being in (pause_short) this spacesuit
(pause_short) R you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) My brain dolphin
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) A lot of it has to do with the with the
(pause_short) the r (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) five dollars and ninety eight cents worth of chemicals and compounds that make you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) We could spend a lot of our life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) it may be (vocal_noises_laughter) a very bad chemi cal bath
(H) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We may
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) that's right
(pause_medium) N well
no (vocal_noises_inhalation) apparent choice
(pause_medium) No choice
(pause_medium) that we know of

(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) As (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) W (pause_medium)

(pause_short) for where I was before I was born
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well how is write (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Anyone who sits down to write a book about death

(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) XX Hector
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Oh God
(pause_short) (TSK) Poor little Hector
(pause_short) He's been having a hell of a time
(pause_short) Pulling his hair out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's been grumpy for three months
(pause_medium) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (SIGH)
(pause_short) He was actually talkative tonight
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He talked to me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Do you know how long it's been since he's been able to k talk to me on the phone
(pause_medium) Kevin
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) Uh well
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then it's (pause_medium)
and then (pause_short) they don't have the third editor
(pause_medium) (TSK) But it's so nice
(pause_short) Him and Ke vin
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Yeah (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) Kevin's his assistant
(pause_short) But they're trying to get Kevin to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Otherwise known as VOX Nixon VOX
Who's gonna take Hector's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Who's gonna (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) nix it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Nixon (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) It (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) I don't know
They gonna (pause_short) bring in some
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) neurotic from New Jersey
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Part of the problem with this whole thing was
that (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was that Ellen was not relinquishing t her duties
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And b it makes sense
Hector (pause_short) had an Emmy
(pause_short) nomination
(pause_short) I would let him run editorial
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They clipped his wings
(pause_medium) There are three shows in trouble
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was not allowed to help on any of em
(pause_medium) None of em
(pause_medium) That's changed now though
(pause_short) like he was before again
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
so unless they f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They have to look for an editor
(pause_short) (TSK) I don't know what he's gonna do
(pause_medium) He wants to work actually features
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (SNIFF)
(pause_short) I went and saw their house the other night
(pause_medium) Where is it
(pause_short) It's um
(pause_short) (TSK)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's one of those streets off of there
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) It's a nice little (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or south
(pause_short) of Sunset
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) How crass
(pause_medium) True cuz (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
But it's in (pause_medium)
who's (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) one of the biggies at MTM
(pause_short) (TSK) or
(pause_short) oh I forgot which one
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It all means the same to me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(vocal_noises_laughter)
Hector was s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the (pause_short) show last week
And I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and I called up to talk to him
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I could hear the (um)
(pause_medium) the musicians in the back ground tuning up their instruments
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_short) you know
I could (pause_short) hear him a little bit
(vocal_noises_laughter) No shit
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I can't hear you at all
sweetheart (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) Call me
when I can hear you (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It was funny
(vocal_noises_inhalation)(pause_medium) That's the only part I'll miss
So (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
His position is pretty (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) stable
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Fletcher (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Well see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So Hector's the one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) when was it
(pause_short) Two weekend (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Two weekends ago
He (pause_medium)
c he said (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Q p_so
(pause_medium) Lina
(pause_short) what happens on Hanukkah (vocal_noises_exhalation) Q
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) And I was going
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I can't exactly remember the story
(pause_short) all I know is you light a candle
(pause_short) And he goes
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I said what
h he di (pause_medium)
(pause_short) never told me why he was calling up Fletcher
so (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm calling Fletcher
(pause_short) I said Q okay
(pause_short) go ahead Q
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So he called Fletcher
(pause_medium) and Fletcher was so (pause_short) relieved
(pause_medium) Cause he wanted to ask Hector to move back to editorial
(pause_short) He's just happy he did it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because he's so unhappy with the editorial staff
(pause_medium) That they couldn't get what they wanted out of Sherry
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
and they couldn't get what it (pause_short) they wanted out of Seppie
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's actually not Seppie's fault
but that (pause_short) Sherry was impossible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) She was a witch
(pause_medium) (TSK) And then her assistant (pause_short) pulled stunts where she didn't (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) do stuff
(pause_short) which I wouldn't know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_short) making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects
(vocal_noises_inhalation) She totally screwed up the the show that they're working on now
(pause_short) I don't know what number that is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Well
(pause_short) v the one they're working on's not always the one that's being shown
But what (pause_short) one is tonight
(pause_short) Tonight
(pause_short) I don't know
(pause_short) Four
(pause_short) Five
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Six
This i (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't know
(pause_medium) We'll have to ch (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if this was really number two
(pause_short) H m
(pause_short) like you said
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because they had such a b hard time with it
(pause_medium) It had so much wrong with it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Hector kept trying to get it corrected
(pause_medium) And they kept stopping him
(pause_medium) (TSK) Cause of her
(pause_medium) (TSK) Cause of her
(pause_short) cause of Jake
(pause_medium) Nixon
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it makes him look like an idiot
(pause_medium) cause he's the director
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Has nothing whatsoever to do with anybody else
(pause_short) It's Jake
(pause_medium) But he'll s (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That's stupid
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So now Fletcher's starting to realize what's going on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's hard
(pause_short) because
(pause_short) the hatchet man actually in the group is Ed
(pause_short) Ed's the one that'll come in
(pause_medium) (TSK) and he'll go ahead and say
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) this is what needs to be done
(pause_medium) Okay
and h (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_short) Fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go
that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (SNIFF) He's too (uh)
(pause_short) namby pamby
(pause_medium) You need somebody to come in and go
(pause_short) (POW)
(pause_short) (POW)
(pause_short) (POW)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) t_So
(pause_short) they're kind of suffering that (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation) from that this year
(pause_short) Not having that on there
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they can't afford that right now
(pause_short) How many countries is it in
(pause_short) M m
(pause_short) All I know is
(pause_short) Oh really
(pause_short) I forgot what it's called
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Some thing (pause_medium)

(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) I still can't (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) God I still can't believe Tim bitching around and
(pause_short) he lied too
(pause_medium) He said that he talked to Ron
(pause_medium) About (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) the way (pause_medium) they were feeling
(pause_medium) of them being the only ones cleaning the house
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean what they don't realize
(pause_medium) shit
(pause_medium) I wanna spend time with Ron
(pause_medium) usually doesn't get home till nine or ten
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) for every little dime that he makes
(pause_medium) You know

(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Tim is on salary
(pause_medium) and he earns leave

(pause_medium) he gets sick leave
(pause_medium) we don't get shit
(pause_medium) (TSK) I don't know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) It is really hard living with another couple
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) we (pause_medium)
If we set our (pause_medium)
(pause_short) If we sit down and set some rules
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it could work
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) what it amounts to
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) he told him
he goes (um)
(pause_medium) what was it he goes
(pause_medium) nobody fucks with my lifestyle
(pause_medium) I feel the exact same way
(pause_medium) And all those bitches and complaints that he has
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're about my lifestyle
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(TSK) (pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_medium) And the only way it's gonna work
(pause_medium) That's right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) going to (pause_medium) our parents
and (pause_medium) complaining about one another
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm gonna tell him
you (pause_short) talk to the person that you have the complaint about
(pause_medium)(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm also going to suggest
(pause_medium) MRC weekly house meetings MRC to discuss such things
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) (TSK) Oh yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) in self assertiveness
(pause_medium) you know and
(pause_short) especially the way (um)
(pause_medium) I mean Tim gets (pause_short) in (pause_short) himself into a
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and his first reaction is to blow up about it
(pause_medium) You know
cause he let (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yep
(pause_medium) He doesn't do nothing (pause_medium) positive about it
(pause_medium) And if something bothers you
(pause_medium) I was
when (vocal_noises_inhalation) I was asked to take over (pause_short) intermediate (pause_short) algebra
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium) And teach it
(DRINK) (DRINK) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And I did
(pause_medium) And I also went
(pause_medium) and I asked for a raise
(pause_medium) instead of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) cause instead of just sitting in the class and getting five dollars an hour
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) and instead of getting the five dollars an hour
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_medium) Now if i (pause_medium)
You know if you (pause_medium) put a situation like that to Tim or Mandy
(pause_medium) cause not because they're (pause_medium) they're weak in character or anything
but because they're (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) They're babies
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) They (pause_medium) hem and haw around
(pause_short) You know (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) And it's
(pause_medium) (TSK) Right now (uh)
(pause_medium) I don't know if I should mention it to him
(pause_medium) I'm feeling like he's taking me for granted
(pause_medium) Yep (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And he's rolling in it
(pause_medium) And you know what the sad thing
(pause_medium) the thing that really scares me
(pause_medium) is that they're n (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) th at the rate they're going
(pause_medium) and with all the breaks that they've (pause_medium) gotten
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they're never gonna have hard times
(pause_medium) Hard times do train you
(pause_medium) Yep
(pause_medium) They do
(pause_medium) Like I came over here to work with Danae
(pause_medium) I'm going to do some (pause_short) translations for her and stuff
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) tonight
(pause_medium) And (um)
(pause_medium) (THROAT) you know

(pause_medium) but like tonight (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) well I called
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) so I called (um)
(pause_medium) Mandy's

(pause_short) I called our house
and I said where's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know where's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) where (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When we were on our way to Tim's game
and he asked what time (pause_short) we'd be home
(pause_medium) And she said then we went over to (pause_medium) your grandma's
but (vocal_noises_inhalation) then we came back
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) I called the Town Pump
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) course he wasn't (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) he was on his way home
(pause_medium) And I said tell (pause_medium)
(pause_short) So I called Mandy back
(pause_medium) have him call me
(pause_medium) when he got home
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) I was in the bathtub when he called
(pause_medium) and I talked to him for a while and
(pause_medium) he went and
(pause_medium) he was really down about what (pause_medium) what I told (pause_short) him that Tim had said to me
(pause_medium) and how I was (pause_medium) so upset
(pause_medium) He goes Q why didn't you tell him to go and wake me up Q
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) I said I did (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_medium) (TSK) He goes
they w (pause_medium)
they were sitting around getting all (pause_medium) fucked up
(pause_medium) he said I went right to bed
(pause_medium) (TSK) Oh
(pause_medium) Cause that five car pile up they had between Hardin and Crow
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Ron was singlehandedly there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) with one wrecker
(pause_medium) G yeah
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) so he had to send Ron by himself
(pause_medium) Did they all hit each other
(pause_short) Kind of
(pause_short) A a semi (pause_medium) bumped a car
(pause_medium) went on two wheels
(pause_medium) just about lost it
and then (pause_medium) (TSK) got back up on all (pause_medium) all its wheels again
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Did it land in the ditch
But it (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Kind of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but all the other cars that were (pause_medium) in the (pause_short) direct (pause_medium) vicinity
(pause_medium) And then
(pause_medium) there was three cars (pause_short) and the semi
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_medium) this (uh)
(pause_medium) this guy (pause_medium) pulled up and
(pause_short) he was going to (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Peggy
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Yeah
(pause_medium) Him and her pulled up
(pause_medium) And they stopped to ask Ron what happened
(pause_medium) And here another car came and rear ended em
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
And they ended up having to take (um) (pause_medium) Peggy White (pause_medium) by helicopter to Billings
(pause_medium) Man that's pretty bad
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_medium) Darn
(pause_medium) this darn dog keeps (pause_medium) breathing
and like (pause_medium) dreaming
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) she'll get scared and want to go outside
(pause_medium) Kinda nervous
(pause_medium) They say you can really (pause_medium) mess up a dog
(pause_short) Really
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) It's so cold outside
(pause_medium) You know what I was thinking of doing
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) what it would be like to (pause_medium) train her
(pause_medium) to pull a sled
(pause_medium) I don't know if she'd do it
(pause_medium) I don't know if she would either
(pause_medium) She's kind of timid
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) She doesn't trust too many people at all
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (pause_medium) (SWALLOW) Oh and you know another thing that Tim had the audacity to bitch about
(pause_short) What
(pause_medium) He said (um)
(pause_medium) Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree
(pause_medium) until four in the morning
(pause_medium) And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there
and they told me that (pause_short) there wouldn't be enough room
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_short) Tim said that
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She was probably lonely when she was doing it
(pause_medium) She probably was
(pause_medium) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) what was I gonna do
she was just (pause_short) putting up the balls and everything and
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she'd say Q where
(pause_medium) where do you think this should go Q and
(pause_medium) so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) you know I was just sitting there watching her
telling her (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) where to put everything and what not
(pause_medium) Did you know Nickie wanted her own tree
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) And I forgot to bring it in
(pause_medium) What are you gonna do with it
(pause_medium) She wants to set it up for her Barbies
(pause_medium) I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) And just stick it in there
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know what I did
(pause_medium) so I just cut a (vocal_noises_laughter) branch off one (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) God
(pause_medium) (DRINK)
(pause_medium) to get em
(pause_medium) You know where Sarah and Arvela live

(pause_medium) Unhunh
(pause_medium) You mean
(pause_medium) kinda like (pause_short) by the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) by the tunnel
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) And I just walked up (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) We just walked up around (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) God Alice that was fun
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Did you get grandma a tree too
(pause_medium) Does she already have one
(pause_medium) Hm m
(pause_medium) (TSK) That pickup could only hold like three
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) I wonder why (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Did daddy say to take the pickup back
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Cause Phoebe needs it
(pause_medium) What's wrong with the car
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Oh
about how the (pause_short) engine was on fire
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) See there was oil spilling out
(pause_medium) leaking out from (pause_medium) the valve cover
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and the oil got hot
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) because we were losing oil bad
(pause_medium) going from Billings to (pause_short) Crow
(um)
(pause_medium) there's a lot of
we had to put like (uh)
(pause_medium) three or four quarts in
(pause_medium) Unhunh
(pause_medium) It was three
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) by the time we got to
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) it was
(pause_medium) it was one quart low
(pause_medium) And there was smoke still coming from under the engine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then it caught fire
cause there wasn't (pause_short) enough water in the (pause_medium) radiator
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well I checked
(pause_short) it was only about
(pause_medium) But that shouldn't make any difference
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is that there was an air lock in there
(pause_medium) And that running the engine out on the open road
(pause_short) Mh m
(pause_medium) flushed it out
And bust th e (pause_medium) gasket
(pause_medium) No
(pause_medium) it would more or less (um)
(pause_medium) the engine wasn't being kept cool enough
(pause_medium) Cause there wasn't enough fluid (pause_short) in the radiator
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) So what
(pause_medium) The engine being too hot
(pause_short) and the oil leaking
(pause_medium) So he knew that the oil was leaking
(pause_medium) (TSK) we knew we were losing oil
(pause_medium) Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So what's he gonna do
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) and two of his wires
(pause_medium) Unh unh
(pause_medium) Unhunh
(pause_short) So we took those off and we
(pause_short) replaced them with some old ones out of the garage
(pause_short) I knew that
(pause_medium) It runs
There's enough (uh)
(pause_medium) radiator fluid in there
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) so that it will
(pause_medium) It's (pause_short) it's enough
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (DRINK) But I think running it out on the open road
will cause it (pause_medium) possibly to shoot more oil out
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) I don't know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh I freaked Cookie and
(pause_medium) Rita and
(pause_medium) Gary out tonight
(pause_medium) Remember the Plain (pause_short) Plainfeather (uh) (pause_short) Claypit
(pause_medium) where that red clay is
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Right there
(pause_medium) I saw my (pause_short) my speedometer just go Brr
(pause_short) like that just down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_medium) What I have to do
(pause_medium) Mhm
Because my (pause_short) fuel pump is now electric
(pause_short) Never used to be
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Hand me that ashtray
(pause_medium) Or your light
(pause_short) P Your light P
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's behind the sewing machine
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
And (uh)
(pause_medium) sometimes it gets loose
(pause_medium) (YAWN)
And (pause_short) no more HI fuel HI
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) So I had Cookie (pause_short) turn on the ignition and turn it off
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) cause see
(pause_medium) then you hear the
(pause_short) the fuel pump (pause_short) come on
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) And if the wire's not connected right
(pause_short) it doesn't come on
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) So I did that
(pause_medium) and I lit a match to find out where I was
(pause_medium) n after everything was hunky dory
(pause_short) then I
(pause_medium) shut the hood
(vocal_noises_inhalation) both Gary and Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) And I turned around and I looked
(pause_short) and I said
(pause_medium) Q did I scare you kids Q
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They wouldn't say anything
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Q yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) But I freaked em out
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) Then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing ((MATCH_STRIKE))_work
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) Said long as I don't drive it fast
(pause_medium) But oh man I don't know
(pause_medium) See the thing about it is
(pause_medium) if I go after Ken
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) to (um)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) I'm not saying I'm gonna (pause_medium) (TSK) pay for everything
(pause_medium) I don't want to be broke around him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Cause I wanna at least be able to put (pause_medium) gas in the car
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter
(pause_medium) (TSK) Mm
(pause_medium) I've been thinking about that
(SWALLOW) (pause_medium) We should all get some money together and
(pause_medium) is there any way he could like
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Cause I'd like to go up there and go to the
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Red Lobster
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Really
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Cause I've been just
(pause_medium) craving seafood
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) When though
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) He goes back to school like the second
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) VOX Oh
(pause_medium) Well isn't there any way
like we (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that we could just meet him up there and
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Bring him down
(pause_medium) I don't wanna take your car
(pause_medium) (DRINK) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) I was gonna ask you and mom
if you could (um)
(pause_medium) take care of Trace for a couple days next week
(pause_medium) (TSK) Oh
(pause_medium) What you got in mind
(pause_medium) I need to get caught up on my work
(pause_medium) (DRINK) Wednesday I have an appointment at nine thirty
(pause_medium) Mom's off
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) That's right
(pause_medium) Yeah I think that'd
(pause_medium) I think that'd (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) work out
(pause_medium) like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her
(pause_medium) And then of course he adores me
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember I was pregnant with Nicky
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) And (uh)
(pause_medium) he really liked me
(pause_medium) when I was pregnant with her
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You know how it is when we're pregnant
we (pause_medium) get real sleepy
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'd fall asleep on the couch
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) And he'd fall asleep with me
(pause_medium) And I remember he would (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I woke up
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) and God
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Was Nicky mad when Trace was a boy
(pause_medium) Kind of
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She thinks I should have twins
(pause_medium) Twin girls
(pause_medium) (COUGH COUGH)
(pause_medium) But I don't think she'll realize the (uh)
(pause_medium) sibling rivalry
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) But I don't know
(pause_short) she's six years old now
(pause_medium) And they say that if there's six years between children
(pause_medium) After four there's almost none
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) Cause they're
(pause_medium) they're kind of in different worlds
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Because
(pause_medium) see
(pause_medium) the next time I have a baby
(pause_medium) Trace will probably be
(pause_medium) about three
(pause_short) four
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) That's when I'm gonna get this shit taken out
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Tammy Kashen has one of these too
(pause_medium) What is it
(pause_medium) Norplant
(pause_medium) Oh really
(pause_medium) Deon told me
(pause_medium) Cause I asked him what (pause_medium) his intentions were with her
(pause_medium) Cause I told him I thought he was too young to be (pause_medium) so involved
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Gwen was telling me that
(pause_medium) Did she talk to you lately
(pause_medium) They had a cyst on her ovary
(pause_medium) And they had to go in and take it out
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Take out that cyst
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (SWALLOW) And it's really screwed up her (uh)
(pause_medium) menstrual p (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) her (pause_medium) hormones
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they said that she might have to get pregnant again
(pause_medium) WH (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) So
(pause_short) and then she goes
(pause_medium) Q so tell (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) I don't know if Tammy would be too happy with that though
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) Seems to me that she's trying to straighten herself out
(pause_medium) pursue a family
(pause_medium) Tammy
(pause_medium) (TSK) What do you think
(pause_medium) I don't know (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Or do you think it might be a matter of convenience
(pause_medium) I think it's a convenience for both of em

(pause_medium) It's also a convenience for Cookie
(pause_medium) Oh yeah

(vocal_noises_inhalation) When we have to prove
(pause_medium) to expose himself to a person
(pause_short) for sexual arousal
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) when we have to prove something like specific intent

in (pause_medium) at least one of the cases
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) prior similar conduct
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) where he acted in (pause_short) a

(pause_short) You know (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) you can see it
(pause_medium) Had he lifted up the paper in any way
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) ((CLAP)) you know
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) like
(pause_short) like this
(pause_short) just like
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) You know
The MRC whole (pause_short) entire (pause_short) time MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) not looking
(vocal_noises_inhalation) at PAPER first he would go like this
(pause_short) with the paper
(pause_medium) And look at me
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) then the whole time under here
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) he looked so hard
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) you know what I mean
It (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
That's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I mean that's gr eat
(pause_short) alright
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of drawing your attention to him
(pause_medium) if somebody's doing that to you
(pause_short) there's no way you're gonna
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) just totally ignore them
cause you're always going to wanna keep (vocal_noises_inhalation) them in your peripheral vision
to ma ke sure (pause_short) where they a re
(um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So let them know that he was do ing that
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) okay
(pause_medium) and then
(pause_short) he sort of pulled the paper aside
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) just
(pause_short) and then
(pause_short) but when (uh) (uh)
(pause_medium) like you come to a stop
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) like about
(pause_short) five minute ride or something
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and we got to like Embarcadero
(vocal_noises_inhalation) PAPER he would just
(pause_short) (TSK)(vocal_noises_inhalation) Tell (pause_short) the jury about that too
and if there was a chance that any man (pause_short) might w alk by
y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) I have a (pause_short) pr report from another case where
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) he wa (pause_medium)
and then when (pause_short) a man would walk by
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) o kay so then you got off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) at your stop
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
and (pause_short) how were you feeling
(pause_medium) Well (vocal_noises_exhalation)
P it was like P (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) CRY s I don't know
(pause_medium) sorry
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) You doing alright
(pause_short) (SNIFF) just
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) why I really wanted to report it this time because
(pause_medium) You know the kids and every thing
(uh) I was
(pause_medium) you know
abuse like that or (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) That's what I was think
it was just like this (pause_short) dirty old man
(SNIFF) And this time
(SNIFF) and (um)
(pause_short) I just felt like
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) and I just
(pause_short) (SNIFF) (pause_short) I just felt upset
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) n CRY (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um
it's (pause_short) it's real ly important that they understand
(pause_short) the feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) my one concern about this case (pause_short) is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) that (pause_short) some people may have the a ttitude of
(pause_short) he never touched you
(pause_short) he didn't (pause_short) make any verbal threats to you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's no big deal Q
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) I have some (pause_short) young single men
(pause_short) on my jury panel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) my (pause_short) worry is that they don't (pause_short) relate to what a woman feels
(pause_short) whe n so mething like that is happening
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if a man exposes himself
(pause_short) a man would never do that
(pause_short) I think (pause_short) more vulnerable peo ple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But if
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) a man (pause_short) were to be exposed to
they would (pause_medium) laugh
(pause_short) or
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or be mad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but they would n't ne cessari ly feel
(pause_short) scared (pause_short) or threat ened
(pause_short) Hi
(pause_medium)(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
so r (pause_medium) relate that information to the jury
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) and then
(pause_short) (uh)
you called (pause_short) the poli ce
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I just
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I was still kind of like shocked
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then there was a different person down there
(pause_short) when I called the BART police
you know and (uh)
(uh)
(pause_short) couple of days after
(pause_short) one of the (uh)
(pause_short) detectives
(vocal_noises_inhalation) called me and then I made a report
(pause_short) we just made a report and he said
(pause_short) he'll submit it and everything
(pause_short) a nd y ou ID'ed him immediately
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
I have (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) a and this is
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) we've got the statement where you immediately said I'm hundred percent sure this is the guy

In his (pause_medium)

She she'll ju (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) m how (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Do I have to look at anyone
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_short) when you go in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) you (pause_short) you don't have to
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) if you feel like you need to take a break
(pause_short) then (pause_short) tell me (pause_short) immediately
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) or ask the judge
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) I was saying to June

(pause_short) They could be your friends
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) y y from all walks of li fe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) they just want to hear your story
and they're not (pause_short) judging you
(pause_short) Um

(pause_medium) went (pause_short) to trial
(pause_short) um
(pause_short) it'll be higher
(pause_medium) if he's convicted
(pause_short) Okay
plus he's got your case pending (pause_short) in (pause_short) Oakland
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if we get a conviction just on one case here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_medium) So

(pause_short) then
(pause_medium) there are two tables right here
(pause_short) I'll be seated at this table
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) the defendant (pause_short) and the defense attorney will be seated at this tab le
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The (pause_short) jury (pause_medium) sits here
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all in a row
(vocal_noises_inhalation) u m

(pause_short) o kay
(pause_short) Alright
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And the judge is seated right here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then there's a woman who sits here who's the clerk
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so when I ask you questions
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) always say yes or no
(pause_short) as opposed to Q unhunh Q or Q unh unh Q
(pause_short) okay
(pause_short) (SNIFF)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if your nervous
(pause_medium) please tell me
(pause_medium)(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) take your time
when you (pause_short) walk in just take a deep breath
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) If I ask you a question that you don't understand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) if (pause_short) we either of us ask you a question where
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) it's a detail that you don't remem ber
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Um (vocal_noises_exhalation)
Is there gonna b (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the other (pause_short) person
(pause_short) his lawyer gonna ask some questions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's
(pause_medium) he's a very polite guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's a young (pause_short) attorney
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) he's
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_short) w when we had the case the last time
(pause_medium) it was a different attorney
And th at attorney (pause_medium) terrorized my
(pause_medium) my one victim that I put on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_short) he (pause_medium) walked up to her
and he was about this (pause_short) far away from her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) sh (pause_medium)
(pause_short) when he walked in initially and he looked at me
(pause_medium) PAR Walter Munson PAR
(pause_short) she said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I (pause_medium) I (pause_short) knew he was a pervert
(pause_short) just by the way he looked at me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So this man walked up to him and he said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) just badgered her
but thi s (pause_short) this attorney is not like that at all
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) he's going to try and focus more on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) discrepancies
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) in your
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) he sat down
(pause_medium) right across from you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
for the most part he'll be (pause_short) polite (pause_short) and gentle
(pause_short) So you don't have to worry about him
(pause_short) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) what hap (pause_medium)
well tell me about the (pause_medium) year ago incident
(pause_short) Um
(pause_short) that one was at night time
(pause_medium) And
(um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember I used to get off ar around nine
and I used to get to (um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the Bart station around ten o'clock
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) he would be (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) I think
(pause_short) P I'm trying to think
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well that's the Daly City one
so he would (pause_short) get on
(pause_short) when I would get on
but I think (pause_short) probably like a different car
(pause_short) same thing
(pause_short) exact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Go up and down the aisles
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) he would do that
(pause_medium) I was terrified then
I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) when people are around
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) at night time he was doing the same thing
(pause_medium) to (pause_short) the Bart police
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I never heard anything again
(pause_short) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_short) Did he use a newspaper that time al so
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and the funny thing is
he just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the only thing he changed this time
is (um)
and (uh) a different bag (hx)
(pause_short) cause he always had a bag
(pause_short) cause the
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) what made the (pause_short) interested in this case
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well
(pause_short) everyone's telling me he has this bag
(pause_short) that's the only difference
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (SNIFF) And they were like Q okay Q
(pause_medium) M
(pause_short) let me see
(pause_medium) a duffel bag
(pause_short) I think
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) P (uh)
(pause_short) Like a sh
(pause_short) like a (pause_short) old be
(pause_short) That's his common one
(pause_short) plastic bag filled with paper s
Y eah (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ok ay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) (STRETCH) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (Hx) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now you can't do anything to this guy
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) M hm
(pause_short) She just don't have no control over her body
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) WH Tr ain WH
When will the (pause_medium) verdict be
(pause_medium)(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) well
(pause_short) Uh (pause_short) you two are my last witnesses
(pause_short) and then the defendant will t esti fy
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_medium) And then
(pause_medium) w we should have a verdict by Friday afternoon
(pause_short) O kay
(pause_short) So I'll call all of you and tell you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He says so
(pause_medium) Mhm
H What could he BR possibly (pause_medium) say BR
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He testified in a trial
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) about five years ago
Sa identical (pause_medium) situa tion
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he said
(pause_short) his testimony was
(pause_medium) He totally denied it
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) cause I was just telling him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
She was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) you're saying f ive years ago
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but he used to
(pause_medium) I don't know
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) she she didn't say anything newspaper whatever
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) do (pause_short) finish the job
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're hard cases
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) to act on
and I think the reason why they finally (pause_short) started (pause_short) acting on these
and (pause_short) getting (pause_short) the identificatio n
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (THROAT) (pause_medium) (TSK) Do you have any questions June
(pause_medium) (YAWN)
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) I'm going to put June on first
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) and then
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) then Rickie (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And then will you let us know what the final verdict is
(pause_medium) P Hm P
(pause_medium) Hopefully it's good news
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) If it's not
(pause_short) I'll be bummed
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I've been living with this case now for so long
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Am I doing that right so far
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (TSK) All the way down to that
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (TSK) WH I WH think
(pause_medium) I don't think I am
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you'd have to have that plus or minus
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Where did I get that (pause_short) square root of (pause_medium)
(um)
(pause_medium) ex squa red
Because you brought this (pause_short) over here
(pause_medium) You brought (pause_medium) three (vocal_noises_inhalation) over here
(pause_medium) divided by three
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then you have ex squared
(pause_medium) I guess all I can't figure out is
what the square root of negative two thir (pause_short) thi (pause_short) two thirds is
(pause_medium) Would that be
(pause_medium) i square root two
(pause_medium) o over three
(pause_medium) The whole thing would be over three
(pause_medium) Square root of two thirds
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
Oh (vocal_noises_exhalation)
WH gosh WH (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) hm

(pause_medium) I'd probably just slap em
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) P Ex squared equals one over the square root of that
(pause_short) the square root of that
(pause_medium) ex equal s the square root of one P
like (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I know
(pause_short) That's what I'm talking about
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) would that one be
(pause_medium) square root of one half
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) It would
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Yep
(pause_medium) But do y'all have to do that
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) you have to like
(pause_medium) have it where you do that
(pause_short) there's no
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) fraction under the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) under the
(pause_medium) in the (pause_short) denominator
(pause_medium) I mean no fraction under the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So then you just multiply
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
Even f or the top (pause_short) one
(pause_medium) Even for that one
(pause_medium) No
For (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) All you do is like go
(pause_short) t (pause_short) two over one
(pause_medium) M m
(pause_medium) Since you have the square root of two on the bottom
(pause_medium) to make that a square
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then you get two
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you multiply the top by the square root of two
(pause_short) and you get
(pause_short) square root of two
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

Cause I sure didn't catch it the first time (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) let's talk about this slowly
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) (pause_short) This is what we came out with
It's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) over the square root of two
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then you (pause_short) multiply that by the square root of two
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(vocal_noises_laughter) That's what I was try (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's what it was
(pause_medium) square root of two (pause_short) over two
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) See everything was (pause_medium) square root two
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) what about (pause_medium) this one
(pause_short) (SWALLOW)
you have i (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you have i square root of three
(pause_short) over square root of three
(pause_medium) I mean z (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) i square root of two over three (pause_medium)
square root of three (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) I can't even say it right
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Over
(pause_medium) do I have another i down here
or just (pause_short) the one i
(pause_medium) no
(pause_short) Just one
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) P three and square root of three
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) i square root of six
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Over three
(pause_medium) Is that right
(pause_short) (TSK) I doubt it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) I really do
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) You can't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You can't multiply
(pause_short) square roots like that
(pause_medium) Square root of two
(pause_short) times square root of three
(pause_medium) is square root of six
(pause_short) is it
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) then that's fine
(pause_short) Then that is right
Isn't that c (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Cause that's the same way you're multiplying there
(pause_short) square root of nine
(pause_short) that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) P okay P
(pause_medium) Where's the test
(pause_medium) P There ain't no telling P
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (SIGH)
(pause_medium) I mean I have it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) The next one
(pause_medium) is
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) (TSK) five ex
(pause_medium) times (pause_medium) ex minus one
(pause_medium) (COUGH) (COUGH)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(um)
(pause_medium) equals
(pause_medium) two
(pause_medium) times one minus ex
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Leah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) And that's easy
(pause_medium) Oh this is easy
(pause_medium) P Ex squared P
(pause_medium) Please say this will factor
(pause_medium) Will it
(pause_medium) Na
(pause_short) you do it
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) It does
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) One and negative two fifths
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I can al ways put tho se back up into the top
(pause_medium) and see if they check
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Let me just try the one
(pause_medium) Five
(pause_medium) I got zero equals zero
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) SING Fingerprint file
(vocal_noises_exhalation) you got me down
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ex
(pause_medium) times
(pause_short) Hang on
(pause_short) Number eight
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Ex
(pause_medium) times
(pause_short) two minus ex
(pause_medium) Two minus ex
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is less than or equal to
(pause_medium) I don't like these
(pause_short) minus four
(pause_medium) Three times ex
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_medium) distribute first
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) P Two ex minus (pause_short) ex squared
(pause_medium) three ex minus twelve
(pause_medium) you get
(pause_medium) WH do that side
so you get (pause_short) ex WH
(pause_short) whoa
(pause_medium) Negative ex squared
(pause_medium) WH two ex minus XX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (TSK) (TSK) (pause_medium) Now do you factor this
(pause_medium) after you do that
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh but first I gotta take out that negative one
don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I can multiply that whole side by (pause_short) negative one again though
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) I have to flip that sign over if I do that
(pause_medium) See it's little rules like that
(pause_short) that I'm not gonna remember
(pause_medium) So if it's a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) if it's less than or equal to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and there's a minus
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Are you tired
(pause_medium) P Not really
(pause_medium) I mean kind of but
(pause_medium) I'm gonna go home in just a few minutes
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I can work on this (pause_short) at home
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) ((HITS_NATHAN_WITH_PAPER))
(pause_medium) Ouch
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (THROAT)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) S (vocal_noises_inhalation) so you say ex (pause_short) plus four
(pause_medium) is greater than or equal to zero
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) P So you say
(pause_medium) ex is greater than or equal to
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) three
(pause_medium) Or
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And if it's
(pause_medium) less than
(pause_medium) do you still do or
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No that's if it's (um)
(pause_medium) in the
(pause_medium) those two numbers
(pause_medium) If there's like a
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) like this one don't look
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But if there's like a
(pause_medium) ex (pause_short) in the middle
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) If you have like one number on one si de
that one's less than or equal to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is less than or equal to ex
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) less than or equal to
less tha (pause_medium)
(pause_short) six
(pause_short) Right
(SWALLOW) (pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) So the final ans (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) P Number nine P
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) I don't know this one so
(pause_short) You don't know how to do this one
(pause_medium) So we in trouble
(pause_medium) Well you apparently knew how to do it
(pause_short) Did I get it right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well you didn't (pause_short) get the whole thing right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) XX
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) So what's that problem
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) absolute value
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) of (pause_short) one half
(pause_medium) minus ex over three
(pause_medium) (WHISTLE)
(pause_medium) Ex over three
(pause_medium) oops
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) is less
(pause_short) I mean is greater than or equal to
(pause_medium) two thirds
(pause_medium) Just (pause_short) plain old (pause_short) two thirds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) How do you get rid of the absolute value things
(pause_medium) Don't you
I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You put
(pause_short) is less than or equal to two thirds
(pause_medium) Or is greater than
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) is greater than or equal to (pause_short) two thirds
(pause_medium) and then
(pause_medium) don't you have like
(pause_short) i or is less than
(pause_medium) and is less than or equal to
(pause_medium) negative two thirds
(pause_medium) What
(pause_medium) Can I see what I did
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
But when you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) when you have absolute value
(pause_medium) when you take the absolute value off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you put negative two thirds (pause_short) on this side
(pause_medium) First I'll just get a common denominator
(pause_medium) So I can do that
You can't do it when it's in the (pause_short) absolute value
(pause_medium) Well I did (pause_short) right there
(pause_medium) Is that why I missed it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) But see if you wanna do that
(pause_medium) Just bring nega (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Just bring two thirds
(pause_medium) over to the other side
(pause_medium) And make it equal to zero
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But then have
(pause_medium) is (pause_short) less than or equal to
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) negative two (pause_medium) thirds
(pause_medium) And that's not absolute value anymore
(pause_medium) Well see
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we've never done it like that
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Let me see
(pause_medium) If that's how you do it
(pause_medium) I mean I'm sure you probably can do it that way
(pause_medium) Cause
(pause_medium) in probably about as long as you have
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oops
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) WH God WH
(pause_medium) It's my own fault
(pause_medium) so long to get math over with
(pause_medium) I should've got it over with right out
(pause_medium) (GASP)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) A bug
(pause_medium) Hey Leah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) She looks so tired
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_medium) She's eating that bug
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Is that what she's doing
(pause_medium) I guess
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) You can do it that way
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) (BURP) Let me see the pencil (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But then
(pause_medium) I guess she (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) WH square root of that WH (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh no
(pause_short) See I put it in the middle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Seven (pause_short) halves
is greater than or equal to (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But you can't put it in the middle
cause if it's (pause_short) gonna be g (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah if it's gonna be greater than that
(pause_medium) Well I guess it can
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) WH God WH
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So one way I could do it (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She um
(pause_medium) flipped that sign over
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) when she you divide by negative two
(pause_medium) which you k did
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) it's right here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh gosh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know what
(pause_short) I'm just gonna skip this one
(pause_medium) No you're not
(pause_short) you're gonna do it
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) So I can't start by d (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Unh unh
(pause_short) Not finding a common denominator
Well I can do (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah but
why don't you p (pause_short) just put the other (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) put (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) once you have negative two thirds on the other side
then you can find a common denom f na (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) common denominator for the whole thing
and it's gonna be the same (pause_medium) denominat or
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't mean that
(pause_medium) I meant once you bring it over there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't ever remember us doing anything like that though
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) There's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars
(pause_medium) in problems
(pause_medium) Hey
(pause_medium) Can I use some of this
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(pause_medium) _Mm
(pause_short) (TSK) See
(pause_medium) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Here it's absolute values
(pause_medium) Right here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) And it's doing it the way that you were doing it
(pause_medium) I'm trying to find one like that one
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See that's the problem
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That
(pause_short) I'm sitting here st worrying about this one right here
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_short) There'll be a different one
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So what do you do
(pause_medium) You find a inequality
(pause_medium) with (pause_medium) an absolute value in it which
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there's one right there
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) See
(pause_medium) I sure didn't see any in the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) examples
(pause_medium) Hm m
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) See
(pause_short) There's no (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) There it is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (THROAT)
(pause_short) See
(pause_short) Here it is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Absolute value of that
(pause_short) you brought
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) brought negative four (pause_short) over to the other side
(pause_medium) P Okay (pause_medium) (SWALLOW) P
(pause_medium) And all that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I know we've never done one like that
(pause_short) where you do that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Can you (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So if it's pointed this way
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) WH Where'd you get that one WH
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) That's a big one (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) You're not kidding
(pause_medium) (SIGH)
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW)
(pause_medium) (YAWN)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Now I just get a common denominator for the whole thing
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Well
take out those (pause_short) absolute value things
(pause_medium) And now this'll be six
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Is that right
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Now what do you do
(pause_medium) Subtract three
(pause_short) from the middle
(pause_medium) And y (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) To which side
(pause_short) To both sides
(pause_short) To both sides
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) P Negative XX P
(pause_medium) two ex
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) P To one
(pause_medium) Yeah
Divide by (pause_medium)
Well just ta (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) And when you divide by a ne gative
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) you have to flip the signs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) And when you do that
(pause_short) it's gonna be a or
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because if you look at it
(pause_medium) cause
it can't be greater (pause_medium) than seven halves
(pause_medium) and less than negative halve at the sa
(pause_medium) So it's gonna be either ex
(pause_short) is less than or equal to negative (pause_medium) one half
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) or
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (pause_short) (SWALLOW)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) P Will you pass me some of that tea please
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) (DRINK) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (DRINK) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Number ten
(pause_medium) Twelve
(pause_medium) Oh good
(pause_medium) What did you want to do after this test
(pause_medium) That's it
(pause_short) I guess
(pause_medium) You gonna study some more tomorrow then
(pause_medium) Oh definitely
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Ex plus four
(pause_medium) over
(pause_medium) three ex minus two
(pause_medium) is less than zero
(pause_medium) WH Is WH less than zero
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (SIGH)
(pause_medium) WH Gosh WH
(pause_medium) Is this the c (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Are you sure we're doing work from the same class that I'm (pause_medium)
that I'm (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Are we
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) It's got the same name
(pause_medium) that's about it
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) I don't even know how you start this one
(pause_medium) Yeah I think so
(pause_short) Cause
(pause_short) the way I start it
(pause_medium) Do I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I left it blank
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyways
back to the (pause_short) the first thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) I l (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) (TSK) Uh I would prefer that WRITING
that you were there (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) on one hand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) what was (pause_short) felt
rather than ha (pause_medium)
than create (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) I don't really f find it to be
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) a (pause_medium) confrontation
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) they wanna be able to just kind of (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) figure out
(pause_medium) quite frankly we have more (pause_medium) problems to resolve interior
than we do (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) outside of it
(pause_short) Hm
(H) (pause_short) I think
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) in my opinion that
(pause_short) that they have to come to grips with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the fact that they are responsible
(pause_medium) for basically what they've created
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
You can't th penalize some body for (pause_short) m (pause_medium)
(H) And the Vetters are (vocal_noises_laughter) somewhat responsible (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) and that's (uh) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That uh
(pause_short) We are not the same
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the faults here
(pause_short) we have to claim responsibilities
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(pause_short) there's manners of of speaking that I was very outspoken about
w that I talked (pause_short) to (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh) Bill and Carmela and Nancy about
(pause_short) you know
and they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)
we did (pause_medium)
they asked me to meet with them about (pause_medium) Teresa's thing
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) that (pause_short) I find v really
(pause_medium) nothing
(pause_medium) to be honest
(pause_short) nothing of any validity
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
And I told her exactly (pause_medium)
(pause_short) well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what I know (pause_medium) to have happ (pause_medium)
and I (pause_medium)
it's (pause_medium)
and I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) anyway
we (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) and and I also said
(pause_short) Uh (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) (THROAT) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (um) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) d Thank you for your l (pause_medium)
we are gonna address (pause_short) this (pause_short) letter of concerns that you've given us
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Um (vocal_noises_exhalation)
she's asked (vocal_noises_exhalation) that
(pause_medium) you know
she want (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know those th (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) my f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or something like that I guess
S they were her summar (pause_medium)
(pause_short) kyu very m very concisely
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) they (pause_medium)
I d (pause_medium)
I really had a ho (pause_medium)
including (pause_short) Nancy
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) M hm
(pause_short) Uh had very (pause_short) little (pause_short) to to (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) to agree with the validity
(pause_short) Okay
It was a matter of (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I just don't
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_medium) see (pause_short) where this is coming from
It's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
these are (pause_medium)
obviously in a personal (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) issue
(pause_short) (H)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) she f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) what happened happened
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well but
My (pause_short) my feeling is
(pause_short) as I told them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if it's that issue
(pause_short) I says
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) I said let's just get real here
(pause_short) I said
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I said
(pause_medium) Period
(pause_short) Unhunh
I don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say (pause_short) anything of that nature
(pause_short) I said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) there (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) She kept saying
(pause_medium) prefacing everything with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) This is not a personal (H) (pause_short) vendetta
(H) (pause_short) Which tells you
(pause_short) that it is
(H) (pause_short) There (pause_medium)
there have been some (uh)
(pause_short) I'll te (pause_medium)
if you can believe it I ha (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I know (pause_short) she (pause_medium)
there was a (pause_short) a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) We had a number of people (pause_short) once
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
like half of the board (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) it was a big mistake (vocal_noises_laughter) of mine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I know
(pause_short) she felt really snubbed
and (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it was (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Thi (pause_short) this was not a w (pause_medium)
I invited people that helped with the market that (pause_short) year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I know
(pause_short) I mean that wa really upset her
(pause_medium) And jeez
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well that's (pause_short) that's the thing that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but anyway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Donna's aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat
(pause_medium) but I'm gonna call her to tell her (pause_short) that
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) Unhunh
(H) (pause_medium) And what we will do (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) what we're gonna probably wanna do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) d during the week
(pause_short) That day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
if we have a (uh) facilitator
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
you and Patricia and (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) D Donna
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) actually spend that day and just say okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) These are the con cerns
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) These were comments
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) these are the ones that we feel we can address
(pause_short) These are the ones that pertain to you
(pause_medium) Yeah
(H) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you mentioned it yesterday
That (pause_medium) that there may be (pause_short) a number of questions
(pause_short) that (pause_medium) just cannot be answered
(pause_short) Without (pause_medium) me (pause_medium) being there
(pause_medium) I (pause_short) I I think it's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know I'm gonna have
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Can we talk l (pause_medium)
(uh)
(pause_short) I bet Pat's gonna (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I dropped her at the bookkeeper
(pause_short) W (pause_short) w (pause_short) why don't you call me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) she'll be (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) Ji (pause_short) Jim and I are gonna have lunch
Uh (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't want to get her (uh) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Sure (hx)
(pause_short) Yeah
(H) (pause_short) um
(pause_short) you wanna do it
where (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what's the (pause_medium)
I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I think
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) what I wanna do
is (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) my my (pause_short) point of wanting to push this retreat
to do it to e (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) to make it sound like we're taking it seriously
(pause_short) Oh yeah
But (pause_short) to also (pause_medium) put into perspective
I did not (pause_medium)
(pause_short) wasn't really in support of one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanna make it sound important
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I want (pause_medium)
but it's also say (pause_medium)
(pause_short) things aren't that bad
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and that what (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)
what we (pause_medium)
even what Ray's attitude with (pause_short) with Barbara
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is completely (pause_short) unheard of
you know and I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I just couldn't be lieve that
I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I had
(pause_short) I came real close to calling Ray
(pause_medium) I'm just gonna blow it off
(pause_short) he's off the board
(pause_short) he's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm not gonna give m (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we've done (pause_short) everything we needed to do
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Dolores was incredibly embarrassed
(pause_medium) by his display
(pause_short) at this time in front of her
(pause_short) Dolores apolo gized for Ray to him
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Yeah
I don't know what's got in (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) because (pause_medium)
w (pause_short) which we know
(pause_short) that's why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound
like he (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and n_you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) same old complaint
(pause_medium) we didn't have any complaints
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think this is one of the first years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that this has been so smooth
(pause_short) we would have allowed him to take a break (pause_medium) four years ago
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Because
(pause_short) and it wasn't so much (pause_medium)
I said it wasn't anything (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that POUND you POUND did
(pause_short) wasn't any thing (pause_short) else
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and Pat did
(pause_short) I said
(pause_short) which was the best thing
(pause_short) I think that was the best thing to do
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But I think
(pause_medium) we need to (pause_medium)
we need to d establish (pause_medium) duties
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) And see part of what we decided with these duties is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) just deciding
(pause_medium) what we need (pause_short) to do what
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) As specific ally as we ca (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
See and I'm (pause_short) I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) on one hand I'd like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes
(pause_short) Pat does that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) really the secretary serves almost no function
(pause_short) There signs (pause_medium)
in the last f y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) Right (vocal_noises_laughter) Phil
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That was it
(pause_short) That was it
That um (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You know
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) and if she really wants to do it
(pause_short) I'm not gonna (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) dissuade her from doing it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But one thing we have to be careful of
that I mentioned (pause_short) to Jim
(pause_short) Yeah
Which is (pause_short) to be careful about (vocal_noises_inhalation) saying things
(pause_short) In interjecting too much
(pause_short) Yes
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I mean
To (pause_short) to speak what she wants
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
But that's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
I've just seen (pause_short) some of the looks
(pause_short) from some of the people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And whether (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I think we have to be careful
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Phil
(pause_short) I mean that goes (pause_medium)
(pause_short) where that came in
It (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
It (um)
You (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you've been much more re sponsive in this sense
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Pat's more opinionated in that sense
You know I (pause_medium)
(H) I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what I try to do
is (pause_short) is is just respond to question (pause_medium)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's fine
That (pause_medium)
But (pause_medium)
See but that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) your (pause_medium)
(pause_short) your position (pause_short) is different
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_short) That's (pause_medium)
Yours is in a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is a much more official capacity
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) And you are th can voice an opinion about things
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) where I thought it (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) was an issue
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) during the annual meeting
(pause_short) Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When we brought up the thing
Was Pat (uh) (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I wasn't there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she was saying
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) I didn't wanna em barrass her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) people kinda going
That was out (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
and if she wants (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) basically the thing is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose Jim because of that
(pause_medium) he feels there's a conflict
And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean he says
(pause_short) There's no question about it
(pause_short) Maybe it s it is gonna be right
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Well he (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) d (pause_medium)
I mean he doesn't seem to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you've talked to him and I've talked to him and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) he seems to be (pause_medium)
I mean he says mayb (pause_medium)
(pause_short) But not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I said right now we have
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) four new board members
(pause_short) Or five
(pause_short) You know
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Four new board (pause_medium)
(pause_short) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
(pause_medium) we're at this point of saying okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) All of a sudden
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we have t all these
(pause_short) you know
and we have (vocal_noises_inhalation) this commitment of time
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) and but they don't know
in the last (pause_short) years
They need to be educated as to (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) See this
(pause_short) no
(pause_short) Because
(pause_medium) I mean I realized
(pause_short) that I'd never seen the bylaws
(pause_short) since I was on the board until (pause_short) I asked for a copy
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now what I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what I have done though
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) any new board member that (pause_short) jumps on
(pause_medium) copies of the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because
(pause_short) I wanna (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
I wanna get these (pause_short) books
but ty (pause_medium)
(pause_short) typically they (vocal_noises_laughter) no one reads em (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
But it's (pause_medium)
At least they've got (pause_medium)
I'm gonna (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) To new board members
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) board members
we need to find out (pause_short) what it is we're doing
(pause_short) Yeah
Whe ther we're doing (pause_short) something right or not
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) B but
(pause_short) Sure we are
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I need to b (pause_medium)
(pause_short) them to (pause_short) kind of commit
(pause_short) To (pause_medium) to being responsible
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) And (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking (pause_short) charge
but th I guess that's what I'm (pause_short) I'm needing to do
(pause_short) Well yeah for (pause_medium)
y (pause_short) y (pause_short) you do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and that's (pause_short) kind of why I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm going to assign things
(pause_short) and we're gonna have
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) Mhm
b (pause_short) people
(pause_short) that'll be given tasks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Like
I didn't need to do all this calling aro (pause_short) to find a r a r retreat space
(pause_short) if I don't do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's gonna fall on you or pat
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Of course
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
And normally that's (pause_short) that's what happens
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) That's okay
(pause_short) (uh)
I I'm a I'm a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know
and Pat's (pause_short) doing things so
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'd better let you go get her
(pause_short) I know
(pause_short) yeah
There (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (H)
(pause_short) If we can go ahead and carry on
(pause_medium) at some point
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is the
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) well the question of (pause_short) meeting quarterly
(pause_short) is that (pause_short) enough
(pause_medium) Meaning having
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know (pause_short) the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It would be enough if committees were to meet
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) and (pause_short) that's the (pause_medium)
but (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that was Paul's (pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) desire
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) And I think
was (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that's what we wanna talk ab (pause_medium)
is quarterly (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
do we need t (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
as a full board every oth (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) uh
(H) but these committees need (pause_short) to be active
(pause_short) and to do their things
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) They need to become (pause_short) somewhat self sufficient
(pause_short) Collections committee
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) I would like to create (pause_short) collections committee to be something where we're almost matching
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) Funds they can raise maybe
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
and have some (pause_medium)
I mean realistically (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Right
For them to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
so that (pause_short) collections
and publications will be all (pause_short) fund raising too
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
that's (pause_medium)
that's where (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Because that's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
we have one board (pause_short) opening
And I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we may think about Gail
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Gail is very interested
and so is this (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) Yeah I know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Jack and I and Jim (pause_short) met with him
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) Jack's financial friend that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is retired
(pause_short) He's a banker
(pause_short) and he'd be good on one hand
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) ideally XX I'd want em both
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) And
(pause_medium) I'm hoping
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what I'm anticipating doing is (uh) (pause_medium)
this retreat (pause_short) might urge people (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) to say
(pause_medium) And so I'm getting
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_short) it might just f (pause_medium) get (pause_short) like Nancy (pause_short) and Kay
(pause_short) I mean I like Kay XX
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See Nancy was going off
She (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
and Kay convinced (pause_medium)
(pause_short) said well Nancy you can't leave right away
and (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) she said okay
(pause_short) But
(pause_short) I don't (pause_short) know why
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
and (pause_medium)
and then we can (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) why (pause_medium)
tha (pause_medium)
(pause_short) At the board (pause_short) retreat
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think it is
(pause_short) basically
(pause_short) people here
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_short) You know
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) there's a point (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Unhunh
XXX (vocal_noises_inhalation)

(pause_short) whether or not he would volunteer
(pause_short) at the marketing center

XXX (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Sam has been
(pause_short) has taken such an interest in this retirement bit
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) That it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it really surprises me
(pause_short) Well she's begun to listen
(pause_short) Yes she has
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (uh)
she used to (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) go over and read a book
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)_Yeah or
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(pause_medium) once you understand it
(pause_short) you know you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I really oughta call
and ask if (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he's still speaking to me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well now he was the one that was up on the (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) left
(pause_short) Up there
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But a anyway
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) I was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit
(pause_medium) because it was POUND Burns that's been ob jecting to our having it POUND
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) And I knew this
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So when he opened up on that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_medium) ((DOOR))
(pause_medium) but at least she wasn't disapproving
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) of it
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) And (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) course Duvall might (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) And I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I cannot get over this
(pause_medium) That man
(pause_short) I really cannot
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know
(pause_short) he must have been thinking
(pause_medium) when he said he wasn't a political appointee
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he must have been (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) associating (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) his relationship (pause_short) with (pause_short) Steit ler
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) I really do believe that
(pause_medium) In his thinking
(pause_medium) I don't know how else he could have (pause_short) done it
That (pause_medium) topples over

he's on mostly (uh) evening hours
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're redoing the pharmacy there at Wel Wallmart
(H) (pause_medium) Enlarging it
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) Well
(pause_medium) and so the fellows in the garden shop
(vocal_noises_inhalation) have to (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) move things out from that area
so they can work (pause_short) on the (pause_medium) pharmacy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well they needed to expand the pharmacy
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) what I had to wait and wait and wait
(pause_medium) So I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Where are they putting the pharma cy
Well they're b (pause_short) leaving it in the same place
they're just (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) taking out two rows of
(pause_medium) of (uh)
(pause_medium) S (pause_medium)
where the (pause_medium) toiletries were
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Just inventory stuff
(pause_medium) Moving it
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) They're (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) But Ted says there's not much garden left
(pause_medium) all of this stuff
(pause_medium) out in there
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he works (uh) (pause_short) six days next week
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) (THROAT) instead of five days
(pause_short) M hm
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) (TSK) And (uh)
(pause_medium) Well
he's been working (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) evening hours and weekends
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) I think I'd hate to be in business right now
(pause_medium) Oo
(pause_short) You can't (pause_short) sit (pause_short) still
(pause_medium) Hm m
(pause_medium) You have to expand
(pause_medium) or something
(pause_medium) (TSK)
to keep (pause_medium) MRC in the main stream MRC
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) Well
they've (vocal_noises_inhalation) expanded
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) But this Wallmart needs
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) needs a larger building
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just too cramped
Your shirt and beads (pause_short) are most becoming
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's the right kind of beads
(pause_short) for summer
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A little girl the other day
(pause_medium) remarked about them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) almost on impulse
(pause_medium) but I didn't do it
(pause_medium) I thought I'd pull em off
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Q these are the only summer beads I have Q
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I like (pause_medium)
I like that b (pause_short) shirt
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know what I had to do
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) This (pause_medium)
What did you (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) this (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See where I sewed right down the middle of that
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Otherwise it would balloon out
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And so I s
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) put it on the machine
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
So it (pause_short) d doesn't gap (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Well it works
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It had a
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it had a
(pause_medium) one of those (pause_medium) bottoms that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh
are (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) what do you call it
(pause_short) A tail
(pause_medium) No
It (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the band
(pause_medium) I don't either
(pause_medium) Makes your butt look thin
Makes your hei (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I went over to a store
(pause_medium) where it says
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (uh) sewing
(pause_medium) alterations
(pause_medium) And all that stuff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said
(pause_medium) for taking that (pause_short) bottom band off the top
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And just making it a straight shirt
(pause_medium) And she said
THUMP (vocal_noises_inhalation) Q eight dollars Q
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I thought
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) that's a little like these catalog things
I saw something in a cat (pause_medium)
the (pause_medium) catalog
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I've been with for a long time
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanted to buy it
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It was a m
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Didn't you notice em
(pause_medium) all beautiful colors
(pause_medium) So pretty
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well anyway
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanted to order that muumuu
(pause_medium) I mean it was around twenty nine dollars
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and two pairs of short pajamas
(pause_medium) One for Sam
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) I looked at the postage (pause_short) attached to it
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I thought good heavens
It's by (pause_short) amounts of POUND money
(pause_medium) Not weight
(pause_short) How much money this costs
(pause_medium) And it's geared according to that POUND
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I thought
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) forget it
and buy another whole (pause_short) outfit
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) I like to get (um) (pause_medium) pillow covers
(pause_short) That you zip on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to protect the pillows
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_short) I went over to Sears
(pause_medium) one time
(pause_medium) Through the (pause_medium) catalog
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I paid postage on it separate
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And do you know the postage came to more
(pause_medium) Than the g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) more than the product
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I (pause_medium)
I w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) That's one of the letters that I'm going to write to USPE
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And just tell them
(pause_medium) That they're gearing this in the wrong way
(pause_medium) It should be geared according to weight
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) That g (pause_medium) cotton (pause_medium)
(pause_short) two pairs of cotton pajamas
(pause_medium) and that cotton (pause_short) muumuu
(pause_short) ain't gonna weigh up to eight (vocal_noises_laughter) dollars worth
Believe (vocal_noises_laughter) you me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) I thought th
(pause_short) I just won't (pause_medium) order from em
I m (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That's (pause_short) foolish
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We better go up to Dillards
(pause_medium) You mean up to Phoenix
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
(pause_short) They (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Pretty c (pause_medium)

Of it (vocal_noises_exhalation)

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Are are you (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) eating Tums
(pause_medium) for calcium
(pause_short) I'm not eating Tums
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) I have (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh I did take
(pause_short) I did s (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) call out last night

(vocal_noises_inhalation) Do you have one of those little things that (vocal_noises_inhalation) has a compartment in it for each day
(pause_medium) No
(pause_medium) Heaven sakes
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm not a very good pill taker
I'm re (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I think I'm resenting
but I have (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm re senting this medicine
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think that (pause_short) the (pause_short) cardazam is
(pause_short) I think that the (pause_short) d diarrhetic is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well now your
(pause_medium) Now look at em
(pause_medium) Now they're s (pause_medium) tight again
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_medium) that (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that the spring broke in my recli ner
And (pause_short) Dorsen's fixed it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You got it fixed up
And (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) And they found out
(pause_medium) that
(pause_medium) it was easier
(pause_short) they went back out the truck
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and got a g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) a whole assembly
The the the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) You know
Makes the XX (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The the the f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the footrest goes out
You know there's a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) a (pause_short) a mechanism there
(pause_medium) So they put a whole new mechanism in on side
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I wasn't prepared for them to (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) I was going to tip them
(pause_medium) but I wasn't prepared
(pause_medium) To b (pause_short) buy the chair
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) Over again (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) S (vocal_noises_inhalation) so (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Well that was enough
(pause_medium) I XX (pause_medium)
They're on salary with the c (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) with the company any way
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But they were so jovial
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) a tight little spring
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that (um)
(pause_short) governed the mechanism
(pause_medium) And held the chair together
(pause_medium) when you (pause_short) put out
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) And I told (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well I think I told you this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I phoned her and said
(pause_medium) I don't know whether I can sit in the chair at all or not
(pause_medium) And (pause_short) I said
(pause_short) and besides
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
and she (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) sh she said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well it's alright to sit on it
but don't put the (pause_medium) footrest out
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) How are we on the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I can't tell when it's done
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) It looks like it's done
(pause_medium) Oh honey no
(pause_medium) It goes for forty five minutes
Well the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It's not the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when that's empty
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) maybe we've talked for forty five minutes
(pause_medium) I don't know whether it's to go off
(pause_medium) Does it automatically go off at the end of (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) well that's what (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
Why sure (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Are you rea dy
Y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Whatever
(pause_medium) Politics deals with the question of power
(pause_medium) That's the introduction to empowerment
(pause_short) What is power
(pause_medium) Very quickly
(pause_medium) all of you should know these two concepts
(pause_short) they're not that difficult
(pause_medium) What is power
(pause_short) Having the capacity to impact public policy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So if we're talking about politics
(pause_medium) And if we're talking about (pause_short) empowerment as a concept
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now does (pause_short) power come in one form
(pause_medium) Different
(pause_medium) Different forms
(pause_short) Back here
(pause_medium) What forms
(pause_medium) Give me examples of power
(pause_medium) Either one of you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Education
(pause_medium) know ledge
(pause_short) knowledge
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) what else
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) your (pause_short) position in the workforce
(pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) Close
(pause_short) num bers
(pause_short) right
(pause_medium) What else
(pause_medium) Social status
(pause_short) Social status
(pause_short) position
(pause_short) right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If you're the chairperson of um (pause_short) a major corporation
(pause_short) would you say that that person (pause_medium) has some power
(pause_medium) Most definitely
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_short) Especially if you're in (uh) IBM
or (pause_short) Chrysler Corporation and
(pause_short) some t_ __
(pause_short) some examples
(pause_medium) gender and race
(pause_medium) can give you power
(pause_medium) Gender race
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_short) Gender race
(pause_short) Let's talk about (vocal_noises_inhalation) race
(pause_short) in terms of power
(pause_medium) If I make the statement which I did
(pause_short) that there's no fear factor
when it comes to (pause_short) the Chicano_Latino community
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and there is much more of a fear factor
(pause_medium) in dealing with the African_American community
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) am I not dealing with a racial factor of power
(pause_short) WH Yes WH
(pause_medium) Because it's gonna affect
(pause_medium) the decision making process
(pause_short) the politics
and (um)
(pause_medium) the policy
(pause_short) Africa_ __
(pause_short) i_ __
(pause_short) Kinda like in past
(pause_short) African_Americans have been more organized
and have (pause_medium) had more leaders
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) or not more leaders
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) Mhm
(H) I mean (uh)
if (pause_short) one looks at what
(uh)
vis a vis (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) who
(pause_medium) The major league
(pause_medium) Baseball teams and all that
(pause_short) Football and all that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What's his underlying argument
(pause_short) What's his criticism
(pause_medium) That there're not (pause_medium) sufficient numbers of (pause_short) what
(pause_medium) Blacks
(pause_short) Well he says minorities
(pause_short) He's smart
(pause_medium) In the (uh)
(pause_short) managerial process of
(pause_short) of (pause_short) professional sports
(pause_medium) Managerial
(pause_medium) owners
(pause_medium) managers
(pause_short) Alright
(vocal_noises_exhalation) Have you heard of a Latino say this
(pause_medium) Or would a XXX Jesse Jackson have said that about Latinos
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) No
(pause_medium) Unh_unh
(pause_short) And (uh) we're gonna get into that
(pause_short) in our discussion
(pause_short) Alright
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) the whole notion of power is very important (pause_medium) to understand
(pause_medium) Some generalities that some people would say are not true
I mean how can (vocal_noises_inhalation) Doctor Montoya say that Latinos have no
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they have two people that are cabinet members
(pause_short) they have (vocal_noises_inhalation) supervisor here in Los Angeles
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well power is relative (pause_medium) as well
(pause_short) It's relative
(pause_medium) Power is relational
(pause_medium) How can you measure power
(pause_medium) Power is impossible to measure
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) In other words
(vocal_noises_inhalation) various ingredients
(pause_short) and say
(pause_medium) A
(pause_medium) B
(pause_medium) C
(pause_medium) D
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We can make generalities
(pause_medium) Position
(pause_medium) Wealth
(pause_medium) All these different things that I've talked about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But power is difficult to measure
(pause_medium) So that
(pause_short) we must deal with the whole question of empowerment
(pause_medium) from also the perspective of potential power (vocal_noises_inhalation) versus actual power
(pause_medium) There is a difference
(pause_medium) If I am
(pause_medium) for example
(pause_medium) the president (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) of (pause_short) a major labor union
(pause_short) or a major corporation
(pause_medium) the position
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) as president of that entity
(pause_medium) gives me so much power
(pause_medium) But yet if I do not know how to utilize
(pause_medium) that entity in terms of its mobilization
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) for a given objective
(pause_short) like a labor union
(pause_short) If I have fourteen million people as members
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I don't show any manifestation of power
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) it has to be measured by what (pause_medium) you're trying to do
(pause_medium) Example
(pause_medium) Labor today
is being challenged by perhaps one of the most (pause_medium) serious (pause_medium) pieces (pause_medium) of __
(pause_medium) not legislation per se
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(pause_short) a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement
(pause_medium) that if passed by Congress
(pause_short) is going to impact (pause_medium) three economies
(pause_medium) Canada
(pause_short) U S
(pause_short) and Mexico
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Labor
(pause_medium) is going to be the most (pause_short) impacted
(pause_medium) How is labor today (pause_medium) mobilizing (pause_short) its great power
(pause_medium) Uh not just the AFL_CIO and its fourteen million members
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but the United Auto Workers
(pause_short) and many other or_ (pause_short) labor organizations
(pause_short) what are they doing
(pause_short) to influence (pause_short) public (pause_short) policy
(pause_medium) Combining power
(pause_medium) Huh
(pause_short) They're combining their power
(pause_short) How are they combining their power
(pause_short) By al_ allying with other
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) unions of workers
(pause_short) among themselves
(pause_medium) Cause (pause_short) environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted
(pause_medium) especially along the border
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) so there's_
(pause_short) there's a lot of coalition building
(pause_medium) But can you say as a historian
(pause_medium) that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago
(pause_short) Taking to the streets
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) good point
(pause_short) They have __
(pause_short) He said
(pause_short) they have lost power
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So your measurement (pause_short) of a loss of power is based on what
(pause_medium) What they can and can't XX
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) You don't see
(pause_medium) what you've read about
(pause_medium) right
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) today
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_short) That's one perception
(pause_medium) Is the Black community less powerful today
(pause_short) in nineteen_ninety_three
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) in nineteen (pause_medium) sixty (pause_medium) eight
(pause_medium) with the poor people's march on Washington
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) or nineteen_sixty_three
(pause_medium) again
(pause_short) on the w_ (uh) march (pause_short) (uh) to Washington
(pause_medium) on Washington
(pause_short) when Martin Luther King gave his (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) famous speech
(pause_short) There were three hundred thousand people
(pause_medium) at that march in nineteen_sixty_three
(pause_medium) Which (pause_medium) period (pause_short) of time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) was a time where Blacks were manifesting much more power
(pause_medium) Today
(pause_short) or nineteen_sixty_three
(pause_medium) When
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) When (uh)
When do (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) nineteen_sixty_eight
(pause_short) nineteen_sixty_three
(pause_medium) during those three periods
(pause_short) when
(pause_short) would you say
(pause_short) Blacks (pause_short) demonstrated (pause_short) much more power
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) They have more power now
(pause_medium) They have more power
(pause_short) Why do you say that
(pause_medium) Cause they're more recognized
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Does recognition give you power
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) P Yeah P
(pause_medium) To a_ __
(pause_short) To some (pause_medium) aspects
(pause_medium) I think
(pause_short) I think the __
(pause_medium) Ah
(pause_short) Explain that
(pause_medium) You have (uh)
(pause_medium) you have African_Americans more institutionalized
(pause_short) in our system now
(pause_short) than they were in six ty_eight
(pause_medium) Today
(pause_medium) they have how many Congressmen
(pause_medium) Thirty (pause_short) eight
(pause_medium) Thirty (pause_medium) eight (pause_medium) congressional representatives
(pause_medium) I don't know how many they had in nineteen_sixty_three
but (uh) probably (vocal_noises_inhalation) no more than two or three if they were lucky
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Would you say that
(pause_short) I would say that's right
(pause_medium) Go on
(pause_medium) What else
(pause_medium) In sixty_eight
(pause_medium) the Blacks were a whole lot more (pause_short) mobile
(pause_short) mobilized
(pause_medium) Much better mobilized
(pause_short) three_hundred_thousand marching on Washington
(pause_short) is an example
(pause_medium) You probably couldn't get that today
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) (COUGH)
(pause_short) During the era of the Vietnam War
(pause_short) Twenty_five_thousand Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles
(pause_medium) a_ at the national Chicano moratorium (pause_short) against the war
(pause_medium) No one
(pause_medium) has come even close
(pause_medium) With the exception of the death of Cesar Chavez recently
(vocal_noises_inhalation) where there were approximately forty_thousand people
(pause_medium) to mobilize
(pause_medium) large numbers (pause_short) of people
into some kind of a (pause_medium) effort or movement
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So he's correct
(pause_medium) It depends (pause_short) on the time
(pause_short) depends on the circumstances
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the form of power
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Institutionalized power is different from
(pause_medium) the unconventional form that (uh) y_ you just described
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well what we're trying to get at
(pause_short) is potential (pause_short) versus (pause_short) actual
(pause_medium) My argument
(pause_medium) as humble as it is
(pause_medium) is that (pause_short) Chicanos
(pause_medium) in nineteen_ninety_three
(pause_short) are fast developing
(pause_medium) a high (pause_short) potential for power
(pause_medium) but they're a long way from actualizing (pause_short) their true power
(pause_medium) Okay
they're_ we're still at the (pause_medium) potential phase of our empowerment
(pause_short) and not at the actual power phase
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) Anything else
(pause_short) On those two concepts
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) Let's get into (pause_short) discussion on voter participation
(pause_medium) I don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics
(pause_medium) but I'll give you some
(pause_medium) general (uh) (pause_short) trends
(pause_short) some statistical information
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that will prove a point
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that will introduce the subject (pause_medium) of (pause_short) political participation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in the United States
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) the participation of the citizenry is imperative
(pause_medium) It is (pause_medium) absolutely imperative
(pause_medium) if it's to be a democracy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now what am I trying to say
(pause_medium) What am I trying to say
(pause_medium) It is (pause_short) imperative for the people to participate
(pause_medium) in the political process
(pause_short) Another way of saying it
(pause_short) What am I saying
(pause_medium) We have to vote
(pause_medium) everyone
(pause_medium) But why is it important
(pause_medium) in a democracy for the people to participate
(pause_medium) Just deal with the question
(pause_medium) Not the methods
(pause_short) You mean because (pause_short) if (pause_medium) the people don't vote
(pause_short) it will be
(pause_medium) there will be an elite group
it'll be (pause_short) more of a (pause_short) monarchy
(pause_medium) that has control
(pause_medium) it won't be a democracy
(pause_medium) Kings
(pause_medium) Well one __
(pause_medium) What
(pause_medium) or one family
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) Close
(pause_medium) There's a royal (pause_short) type of family right
(pause_medium) king
(pause_medium) not elected
(pause_short) alright
(pause_medium) hereditary
(pause_short) alright
(pause_medium) But what am I getting at
(pause_medium) W_ what's the essence of what I'm asking for
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_short) Fire away
(pause_medium) By (pause_medium) its very nature
(pause_short) democracy demands (pause_medium) voting
(pause_short) Stop right there
(pause_short) You made a statement
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What is a democracy
(pause_medium) Democracy is rule by the people
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) L Demos (pause_medium) cratos L
(pause_medium) People (pause_medium) rule
(pause_short) The Greeks were (pause_short) major contributors to this political process of development
(pause_short) of concepts
L Demos (pause_medium) cratos L
People (pause_medium) govern
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) We tell the world
(pause_medium) that democracy (pause_medium) is what (pause_short) we practice
(pause_short) Is that what we tell the world
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) What else do we say
selling (pause_medium) our political system
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In selling our political system
(pause_medium) we make it synonymous
(pause_medium) synonymous (pause_short) by saying that
(pause_short) we don't distinguish
(pause_medium) the form of economic system
(pause_medium) versus the political system
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that we put it in the same kettle
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Democracy
(pause_medium) and capitalism
(pause_medium) are essentially the same
(pause_medium) Are they the same
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) But yet we do
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) if we (pause_short) listen carefully
(pause_short) and read carefully
(pause_medium) all these books on international relations
(pause_medium) foreign relations and so forth
(pause_medium) what is it that we tell the world
(pause_short) that America is
(pause_medium) The cradle (pause_short) of democracy
(pause_medium) We are the cradle of democracy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we are the bastion of the free world
(pause_medium) et cetera et cetera et cetera
(pause_short) And when (vocal_noises_inhalation) Ronald Reagan was in power
(pause_medium) we talked about the evil empire
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Categorizing
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) and the so_called Communist empire
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) I say this because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) there is
(pause_short) a tendency for some of us to believe
(pause_short) we have been conditioned
(pause_medium) Who conditions us to think the way we think
(pause_short) What did we deci_ __
(pause_short) What did we say
(pause_short) earlier
(pause_medium) talking about culture
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) they learn through (pause_short) schools
(pause_short) through their families
(pause_medium) Schools
(pause_medium) The media
(pause_short) Everything else
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I mean
(pause_short) doesn't the media tell us that there's only a two_party system in this country
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) that the Communist Party
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) all these parties that we have
(pause_medium) supposedly minority parties
(pause_medium) don't get the same kind of treatment
(pause_medium) as the Democratic and Republican parties
(pause_medium) They're not mainstream
(pause_medium) We have a two party system
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties
(pause_short) That's a l different subject
(pause_short) But I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) What I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) if we look (pause_medium) into the realities
(pause_short) of what we have as a political system
(pause_medium) we tell the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a supreme court
(pause_short) we have a presidency
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we have a political system
(pause_medium) governed by certain principles
(pause_short) and laws
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that emanate from what
(pause_medium) The Constitution
(pause_medium) which is a living document
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That is very much the document that protects
(vocal_noises_inhalation) conceptually and otherwise
(pause_medium) our way of life
(pause_short) Our democracy and so forth
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) if we remember (pause_short) our Chicano history
(pause_medium) my point
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) it's difficult
(pause_short) for us as Chicanos
(pause_short) as we get into it
(pause_medium) to understand
(pause_medium) why is it
(pause_short) including ourselves
(pause_short) because a lot of Chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote
(pause_short) why don't we participate
(pause_short) and they come up with all kinds of (vocal_noises_inhalation) somewhat superficial analysis
(pause_medium) that
(pause_short) much of our political behavior
(pause_medium) is a product of what (pause_medium) was covered in this class
(pause_short) under history
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and culture
(pause_medium) Two
(pause_medium) major currents
(pause_medium) of history
(pause_medium) two (pause_short) major currents of political culture
(pause_medium) right
(pause_medium) I'll get back to that concept
But just (pause_short) general terms
(pause_short) What is political culture
(pause_medium) What is political culture
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) I want you to think (pause_medium)
(pause_short) because you're gonna (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It's very important that you understand that concept
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I want (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Thing I want to underline here
(pause_short) is that
(pause_short) we are products
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of a historical
(pause_medium) dualistic process
(pause_medium) Mexico's history
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we're a pr (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) A cultural process
(pause_medium) and American
(pause_medium) Whatever American means
(pause_medium) So those two major (pause_short) ingredients
(vocal_noises_inhalation) have molded
(pause_medium) that I'm using in this class
(pause_short) to explain
(pause_medium) why is it
(pause_medium) that we're still
(pause_medium) at the potential phase of empowerment
(pause_medium) and we still
(pause_medium) have a long ways to go
(pause_medium) before we realize
(pause_short) that concept that I describe
(pause_medium) called empowerment
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But before we get into that s (pause_short) substance of that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is that
(pause_medium) I wanna just briefly cover
(pause_medium) that
(pause_medium) even though
(pause_short) I'm saying that
(pause_medium) Chicanos do not vote in great numbers
(pause_medium) And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The fact is
(pause_medium) as I mentioned earlier
(pause_medium) that even though we tell the world
(pause_short) we are this beacon of light
(pause_medium) of freedom
(pause_medium) of liberty
(pause_short) justice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) by and large
(pause_medium) not (pause_medium) a lot of people (pause_short) participate (pause_short) politically (pause_short) across the board
(pause_medium) I don't care if you're African American
(pause_medium) I don't care if you're Asian American
(pause_medium) and I don't care if you're Latino
(pause_medium) Most Americans
(pause_medium) do not vote
(pause_medium) in great numbers
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) it's a double whammy
(pause_medium) Introducing the subject matter here
(pause_medium) Americans
(pause_short) in comparison to France
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in comparison to Germany
(pause_short) in comparison to Italy
(pause_medium) we don't vote
(pause_short) in the numbers that they do
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Italy for example
has (pause_medium) a voter (pause_short) turnout
(pause_medium) of ninety percent
(pause_medium) Of those that are eligible to vote
(pause_medium) we're lucky if we get fifty percent
(pause_medium) Are we (pause_short) less democratic
(pause_medium) Are they more democratic
(pause_medium) Why is it that Italy has
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a much larger
(pause_short) a higher voter (pause_short) level of participation
(pause_medium) Or Germany
(pause_medium) Or even Canada
(pause_short) Seventy percent
(pause_medium) The fact is
that democracy in this country (pause_medium) is dying
(pause_medium) I want you to put that down
(pause_medium) Cause it's gonna be important
(pause_medium) At least for my analysis
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you have plenty of time
(pause_short) One week to think about it
(pause_medium) American democracy is dying
(pause_medium) I want you to put that (pause_medium) whole (pause_short) phrase (pause_short) in black and white
(vocal_noises_inhalation) American democracy is dying
(pause_medium) and I want you to try to think (pause_short) of why
(pause_short) As we get into the discussion (pause_short) of Chicano (pause_medium) participation
(pause_medium) And we'll get back to that statement (pause_short) next week
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) for us
(pause_medium) That's another point I wanna underscore
(pause_medium) Because if the (pause_short) larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole
(pause_medium) you're at the very bottom
(pause_medium) with all the problems of poverty
and all the social problems that we're (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we've been talking about
(pause_medium) it's understandable why
(pause_medium) perhaps
(pause_medium) Chicanos do not vote
(pause_short) or participate in great numbers
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_short) the literature
(pause_short) in political science
(pause_medium) dealing with
(pause_medium) factors influence (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) influencing voting
(pause_medium) are many
(pause_medium) Are many
(pause_medium) Civic Culture
(pause_medium) Almond and Verba
(pause_medium) nineteen seventy two or so
(pause_medium) is one book that you can look at
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) there's a book by (pause_short) Raymond Wolfinger
(pause_medium) Steven (pause_medium) Ronsteen (pause_short) Ronstone I'm sorry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Who Votes
(pause_medium) that's another book
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) the literature goes on and on
(pause_medium) But all I want to do
in terms of just giving you (pause_short) some idea
(pause_medium) of what are the factors that influence
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And there are essentially five
(pause_short) You can (pause_short) probably develop more
(pause_short) these are general categories
(pause_medium) Most of the literature in political science
(pause_medium) and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that
(pause_medium) people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty
(pause_medium) What does that mean
(pause_short) A sense of duty
(pause_medium) They regard participation as important
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) why would you say
(pause_short) that this (pause_short) is a factor that influences voting
(pause_medium) Now this is a very somewhat altruistic
(pause_medium) (uh) value
(pause_medium) A sense of (pause_short) duty
(pause_medium) Why
(pause_medium) Why would you say
(pause_medium) that people in this country have a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Some people that vote
(pause_short) vote because they have a sense (pause_short) of (pause_short) duty
(pause_medium) Why
(pause_medium) Right here
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_short) probably it stems mostly from
(pause_medium) your education
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) you're an American citizen
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) towards other people and
(pause_short) to vote
(pause_medium) Because without you
(pause_short) then y we won't have government
(pause_medium) Same sense of jury duty
(pause_short) Jury (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Good point
(pause_short) As we go through some of these
(pause_medium) these five
(pause_medium) I want you to think of the agents of socialization
(pause_medium) Because then I want you to think
(pause_medium) how do those agents affect (pause_short) us as Chicanos
(pause_medium) number one
(pause_medium) Who is responsible for inculcating (pause_medium) that sense of duty
(pause_medium) One
(pause_medium) the family
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) Remember
(pause_short) The family is your primary agent
(pause_short) Two
(pause_medium) the educational institutions
(pause_medium) I mean
from the time that you start (pause_short) kindergarten
to the time that you (pause_short) graduate from the university
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's constant
(pause_short) not constant
(pause_short) but somewhat of a consistent (pause_short) bombardment (pause_short) of values
(pause_short) attitudes
(pause_medium) reinforcing the nature of the political system
(pause_medium) and the virtues (pause_short) of (pause_medium) participating in the political process
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So in essence
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) I think that it's more (pause_medium) eye opening
(pause_short) to see
(pause_short) that
(pause_short) this doesn't exist
(pause_medium) more than it does
(pause_short) And that's why people don't vote
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It seems that
(pause_short) I mean you talk to people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they have an attitude
(pause_short) I can't make a difference
(pause_medium) That's why I don't vote
(pause_short) It's not (pause_medium) my (pause_short) responsibility
(pause_medium) There's not a sense of duty
(pause_short) Even though
(pause_medium) like you said
(pause_medium) from the beginning
(pause_medium) supposedly we're getting it (pause_short) all through school
(pause_medium) And this is a (pause_short) much
(pause_medium) of a recent phenomena
(pause_short) much more
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because you've had
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) declining voter participation levels
(pause_short) And I'm giving you the answer
(pause_medium) Wa what what what has been the problem
(pause_medium) Contributing to what you (pause_short) just said
(pause_medium) Well
I agree (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I think m maybe one of the reasons could be
(pause_short) they're not being represented
(pause_short) they don't
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) see any like (pause_short) direct results for them
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) the government
(pause_short) and who's in control
(pause_medium) Okay
I think I (pause_medium)
I n (pause_medium)
That's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) alright
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I mean (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Would you agree with that
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) they vote their pocketbook
(pause_short) They (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They're (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) They vote definitely their pocketbook
(pause_short) That's true
(pause_medium) What would you add to f
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) you say we're not represented
(pause_short) between
(pause_medium) say like (pause_short) the last
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) you voted for (pause_medium) Clinton or
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) whatever his name was
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) No
I don't think (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't think there's as much trust
(pause_short) XX
(pause_short) Why
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to Watergate
(pause_short) Now l let's talk about that
What what did (pause_medium)
What did (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You (pause_medium)
(pause_short) in the beginning
(pause_short) well even in the late sixties you had Vietnam
(pause_medium) you had (uh)
(pause_short) Excellent
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What did Vietnam do
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) Turned (uh)
(pause_medium) the youth especially
against (pause_short) the government policies
(pause_short) the educated youth
(pause_medium) More so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and those were
(pause_short) I think
(pause_medium) the people that were gonna be voting
(pause_medium) as they went on
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) On that score
(pause_medium) would you say that most of you
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) of the sixties
(pause_medium) All of you were born in the sixties
(pause_medium) Early seventies
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) So that means that most of your parents
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
were very much a part (pause_short) of the era of the sixties
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) go back to you
(pause_medium) that your parents were very much influenced by the Vietnam war
(pause_medium) One way or the other
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Which (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Which way
(pause_short) Which direction
(pause_medium) total apathy
(pause_medium) Total apa thy
(pause_short) Why
(pause_short) Um
(pause_short) well my mom
(pause_short) Total apathy
(pause_medium) She just
(pause_short) I th (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't know
(pause_short) I think she just got burned out
(pause_medium) you know
and seeing another (pause_medium) corrupt man
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) another scandal breaking out
(pause_medium) She knew friends that were dying in Viet (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
She had friends that (pause_medium) were drafted
(pause_short) were dying
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) she just didn't care anymore
(pause_medium) I think it was just a lot of negatives had built up
and she just (pause_medium) let it go
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) How about your parents
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) well my dad was drafted
(pause_short) He was in Vietnam
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) long story
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_short) My mom claims she was too young to know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) I don't know (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) I don't know how my dad really felt about it
(pause_short) I know
(pause_short) we come from a long line of military men
(pause_short) so he kind of felt a sense of duty
(pause_medium) so
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (um)
(pause_medium) Was there a sense of betrayal
(pause_medium) Possibly
(pause_medium) Who else
(pause_short) Who wants (pause_medium)
(pause_short) about what we're trying to say
(pause_medium) It's the best
(pause_short) Why do these cans
(pause_short) get so warped
Only the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Only the Sam's Club cans (pause_short) get so warped
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I think you should write (pause_medium)
Cause they're X (pause_medium)
Just (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) write a letter to em

(pause_medium) Okay
One large loan (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) renewed (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) a hundred ninety seven (pause_short) thousand
(pause_medium) It's on Gerald and Pamela
(pause_medium) O kay
(pause_medium) no problem
(pause_medium) He's handled his line of credit as agreed
so it's (pause_short) pretty routine
(pause_medium) Joe
(pause_medium) P Okay P
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) First (pause_medium) loan request I have
that (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) will be (pause_medium) refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Customer is Gerry and Pamela Tucker
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) at sixty one fifty eight Main Street
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're requesting eighty four thousand dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal
(pause_short) title work
(pause_short) and points
(pause_short) Eighty four
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Eighty four even
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_short) Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) would be seven sixty one eighty nine
(pause_short) based at the current thirty year rate
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) They estimate the value of their home to be (vocal_noises_exhalation)
one hundred (vocal_noises_exhalation) and ten (pause_short) thousand dollars
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We had an appraisal in nineteen ninety one
(pause_short) that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Eighty percent of that would make it (pause_short) eighty two four
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) um
(pause_medium) in order to make them a loan for eighty four thousand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty four
(pause_short) and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket
(pause_medium) Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) their liabilities (vocal_noises_exhalation) eighty (pause_short) three
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) their (pause_short) net worth (pause_short) thirty one
(pause_short) So all they owe is the house
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and after the refinance
they would have a (pause_medium) debt to income of fifteen over twenty three
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I missed that
(pause_medium) They're fifteen over (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) They're currently (pause_short) twenty
(pause_medium) They can't be
I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Twenty
(pause_medium) Twenty over twenty seven
You can't even (pause_medium)
Twenty over tw (pause_medium)
I couldn't even read my f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's twenty over twenty seven
(pause_medium) What is acceptable pretty much
(uh)
(pause_short) what figures
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Twenty eight over thirty six is the maxe s
(pause_short) so they're well within
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) I just wondered
(pause_short) They're well within their (pause_short) debt to income
I (vocal_noises_inhalation) always heard the figures
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
So you said they're gonna be (pause_short) fifteen
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Fifteen over twenty three so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) their debt to income (THROAT) isn't a problem
(pause_short) the
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) problem as I see it is
(pause_short) the value of the house
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and the second (vocal_noises_exhalation) matter at hand is
(pause_short) in nineteen eighty seven
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they had filed a chapter eleven
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They had at the time a mortgage with us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They reaffirmed on that mortgage
(pause_short) They were never late
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(uh)
(pause_medium) After that (pause_short) discharge
we even advanced them (vocal_noises_inhalation) money to purchase this house
on Main st (vocal_noises_inhalation) Street here in Hillsdale
and (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) they have never missed a payment on that loan
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I've also made them car loans
that they've never missed a payment on (vocal_noises_exhalation)
and (um)
as long as they have (vocal_noises_inhalation) been discharged
(pause_short) at least two years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_medium) reestablished and paid as agreed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) their credit obligations
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) With that in mind (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I am moving
that they app (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (uh)
subject to (vocal_noises_inhalation) a (uh) (pause_short) certified appraisal of their home
(pause_medium) Do we have the discharge
(pause_short) Yes
(pause_short) I have a copy of it
(pause_short) It was discharged on
(pause_medium) November
(pause_medium) (uh) no
(pause_medium) Two twenty three eighty eight
(pause_medium) Discharge date was two twenty three of eighty eight
(pause_short) When did they file
(pause_medium) In eleven
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Three months
(pause_medium) That's pretty fast
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
It was a business (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it was pretty cut and dried
(um)
(pause_short) debt
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and apparently nobody objected to the
(pause_short) the bankruptcy
(pause_medium) Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors
(vocal_noises_inhalation) All the debt that was (pause_short) charged (pause_medium)
that was bank (pause_short) filed bankruptcy against was (vocal_noises_inhalation) unsecured creditors
(pause_medium) And they discharged em
(pause_medium) (TSK) Yeah
in a three mon (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) No I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I just
(pause_short) it's unusual that they don't require em to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See
the from what I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I gathered is the
(pause_short) unsecured creditors got nothing
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and the secured creditors
(pause_short) just carried on their payment history as agreed
(pause_medium) As originally set forth in their contracts
(pause_medium) But you know usually the plan'll provide some period of time of protection
Oh I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
But if we've got (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) But if we've got the (pause_short) discharge
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) notice of joint (pause_medium)
(pause_short) discharge of joint debtors
it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it appears the persons named above
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) joint (pause_short) case under title eleven
(pause_short) on November twenty third
(pause_medium) And that an order of relief has been entered
(pause_medium) no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed
within the time fixed by the court (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) Ten minutes
Or (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
And (um)
and that they're (um)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
That (pause_medium)
(H) I have a lean (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) nineteen eighty eight
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
That's all (pause_medium)
I just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
That's what I was just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I assumed it would've been
like eighty (pause_medium)
(uh) ninety two or something
(pause_short) What (pause_medium)
the five (pause_medium)
(pause_short) What actually happened to them
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) was
(pause_medium) she opened (pause_medium) a franchise
(pause_medium) And it was
(pause_medium) a franchise of doing packaging
(uh)
from a mall (pause_short) basis
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) gift wrapping
(pause_medium) and ship ping
(pause_short) They should have gotten into the business
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then they would've had a Christmas season
There was a t (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It got to be real complicated
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they didn't get in until February
(pause_medium) Well February they had nothing to do and
(pause_short) and I think they
They hung in there for (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) a year (pause_short) and a half
(pause_short) And they just couldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) couldn't see end to it
XX (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
I'll s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'll second then Joe
(pause_medium) So it's moved and seconded (pause_short) to (uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) approve that loan subject to the
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) appraisal by a certified appraisal
(pause_medium) And the max is eighty four
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) (TSK) All in favor aye
(pause_medium) Aye
(pause_short) Opposed same sign
(pause_short) Motion carries
(pause_medium) (SIGH)
(pause_medium) Is that the only one (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's the only loan I have
(pause_medium) I got one small one
(pause_medium) The only reason it's in here
(pause_medium) is because the borrowers already have
(pause_medium) three hundred three thousand borrowed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) but if we
if Jim and (pause_medium) Kurt approve it today
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) they wanna borrow forty f (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Dave wants to borrow forty five hundred dollars to
(pause_medium) finish paying off (pause_short) the renovation
(pause_short) and upgrade necessary on the (pause_medium) daycare
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) he had (pause_medium) initially thought what he borrowed would do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He wants to set it up on a year
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) um
(pause_short) you know his debt to income is relatively high
(pause_short) the daycare is scheduled to open (pause_medium) a week after the fifth
(pause_medium) So around the twelfth to fifteenth of January
(pause_medium) he thought he's been (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he thought he was already opened
(pause_short) Cause there was articles in the paper
(pause_short) he had his ads out and everything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed
(pause_medium) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) one group of state people
the people that do all the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) do the testing for
(pause_short) electrical and safety and stuff have been there
and now the state (vocal_noises_inhalation) inspector's got to come in
I guess they just (pause_short) look at (pause_short) the quality of the facility
(pause_short) Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is it clean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They're supposed to be there the fifth
(pause_short) and he said
that it usually takes (pause_medium) a week
(pause_medium) for them to send a report in
and (pause_short) for their license to come back
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he gave me some numbers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of
(pause_short) mostly out of their house
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So they fully expect income (pause_short) to exceed the projection
(pause_short) but right now they don't have any income
other than from (pause_short) his job
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) XXX
(pause_medium) What (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And he's gonna have twenty five people
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The building is (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) At l east twenty five children
Twenty five (pause_medium)
See they're e (pause_medium)
he hopes to get up (pause_short) around fifty
(pause_medium) See they're looking at four people
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I've gone through the build ing
(pause_short) and it is (uh)
(pause_medium) a r very (pause_short) very nicely done (pause_short) operation
I mean there's nothing (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) shoddy about the workmanship
or (vocal_noises_inhalation) the cleanliness of the
(pause_short) of the building
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No
They (pause_medium)
(pause_short) where he was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) where he had his
(pause_short) his cabinet sh op
(pause_short) And was living in it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's like anything
when you're dealing with th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) they
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
and they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) There's a lot of this going on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would move
(pause_medium) since it's secured for forty five hundred
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would move that we (pause_medium) advance the funds
(pause_short) I'll second it
(pause_medium) Except
(pause_medium) they owe pretty much
(pause_short) Three hundred three thousand
(pause_medium) and some odd dollars
(pause_medium) But he's always serviced
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) and they do have (pause_medium) the income
the income doesn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) I say they have it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Once the daycare gets up to twenty people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They'll fall back under the forty percent
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) but
(pause_medium) you know
it it (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) and his overall debt (pause_short) is working down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You just
I guess you can't say too much if they're (vocal_noises_inhalation) paying on time
Uh (uh)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) And I think they're about to the point (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
I think if th (pause_medium)
th th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He's already talking
(pause_medium) start looking at expanding that (pause_short) storage facility
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's one of those things
I think there's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they're always gonna have (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) quite a bit of debt
(pause_short) Cause
you know he's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that's kind of their
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know he's looking at that as his retirement income
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Well it's been moved and seconded
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) to approve
but (pause_medium) that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) we can't really disburse on that
(pause_medium) That
(pause_short) due to his size
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) of the loan
until we have all (pause_medium)
They need f f (pause_medium)
Four (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (uh) f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) all in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm voting (pause_short) in favor of it
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) See I was (pause_medium)
So see I've got two (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'll get hold of two more
but he didn't (pause_medium)
s (pause_short) Dave didn't get in here until
(pause_short) after he was gone
(pause_short) so
(pause_medium) that's the only one I have
(pause_medium) Any other loans
(pause_medium) No other loans to be discussed
(pause_medium) I got a (pause_short) couple things here
but (uh)
(pause_medium) we'll (um)
(pause_medium) the one
(pause_medium) is in regard to
(pause_medium) the retail
(pause_medium) nondeposit investment
(vocal_noises_inhalation) just to kind of bring us up to speed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) m (pause_short) Matt has tentatively accepted our (pause_medium) offer for employment
(pause_medium) but since he's going to be a dual employee
(pause_medium) th (pause_medium)
XX (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
I'll I'll c (pause_medium)
I'll catch up (pause_short) the board up to speed
because (vocal_noises_inhalation) it has some loan relevance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Uh he was interviewed by LCL
Larry Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Larry called me this morning
(pause_medium) that's who had called about seven thirty
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) what (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what we have set up is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) at LCL's office
(pause_short) on (uh)
(pause_medium) for (pause_short) Monday evening
(pause_medium) Tuesday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and Wednesday training
(pause_short) The f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will be very specific for him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) their workflow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) On Wednesday then
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there may be four or five other asset managers with him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) discussing sails (pause_short) motivations and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_short) and sales approaches and strategies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) Larry said
(pause_medium) philosophically
(pause_medium) He said that's our decision
(pause_short) Of which
(pause_short) I you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do
you (pause_medium)
he should be (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So I I'm
(um)
tho (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that looks good
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What I did
(pause_short) kind of
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in regard to that
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) I don't have this date finalized
(vocal_noises_inhalation) s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm trying to go maybe the second week (pause_short) of (pause_short) January
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to have (pause_medium) a representative of Bankers Systems
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) come THUMP here THUMP
(pause_medium) to do some specialized training
(pause_medium) within the qualified retirement plan (pause_medium) area
(pause_medium) Matt needs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Matt (pause_short) needs an understanding of
(pause_medium) not a detailed understanding
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so that he w (pause_medium) can have
(pause_medium) so he understands how
(vocal_noises_inhalation) his products plug into the (vocal_noises_inhalation) to the self directed IRAs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We also
(pause_short) it would do us (pause_short) good to know what products we can offer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) under those qualified retirement plans
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) (uh) R (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) supposed to come down
(pause_medium) I haven't set up a date
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) but
(pause_medium) he'll be here (pause_short) on a f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Vivian
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) sometime during the day to the two of you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because as loan officers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you have a good (vocal_noises_inhalation) handle on (pause_short) borrowers and
(pause_medium) and can kind of tell them of these SEPs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
we've kind of hesitated in (pause_short) in offering those
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Offering the self directed we're getting
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we need to get a dif (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Instead of (vocal_noises_inhalation) called an IRA
(pause_medium) it's called an IRA SD
(pause_short) for self directed
(pause_short) And then
(pause_short) that will allow people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to
(pause_short) if they don't want (pause_short) all their funds in (pause_short) a bank CD
as (pause_short) as are custodial IRA arrangements
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all those funds have to be in First National Bank of Hillsdale
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The self directed
(pause_medium) the (pause_short) the participant signs a (vocal_noises_inhalation) an investment (pause_medium) direction
(pause_medium) or
(pause_medium) where where (pause_medium) he directs (pause_medium) the investments
(pause_medium) They sign the form
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) the
(pause_short) what
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) the SEP (pause_medium) has a vehicle
(pause_short) has to be connected to the IRA
(pause_medium) So we take the SEP off the shelf
(pause_medium) and then if the person (pause_short) wants that money put into a bank CD
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then we just use our custodial (pause_short) IRA forms
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) If (pause_short) they want a self directed i (pause_medium) SEP
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you take the same (pause_short) SEP form off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but you're using a different (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) IRA
(pause_medium) You're not using the custodial IRA arrangement
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) An SEP must have an IRA (vocal_noises_inhalation) attached to it
(pause_short) So that (pause_medium)
the IRAs all fit in the same (pause_short) plan
(pause_short) They're just different (pause_medium) ch boxes checked off of this overall (pause_medium) plan
(pause_short) the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back
They (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Exactly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) I (pause_short) I had talked with (pause_short) with Rick (uh) Brady today
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_medium) he's gonna send me those forms
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The other (pause_medium)
but (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's really not a cost
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) it's kind of a s (pause_short) flip flop
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self directed IRAs ourselves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Because of how complicated the law is in all this
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_medium) coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive account (H) maintainance services
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Isn't that XX (pause_medium)
(pause_short)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) what what what we would do is
(pause_short) they would take care of the account maintainance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In a similar manner
as (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) they take care of the
(pause_short) the other qualified plans
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We (pause_medium)
They (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) We send them the information
th (pause_medium)
They (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) and they file whatever needs to be filed
(H) The (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It's really not gonna cost us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we use their eight hundred number
(pause_medium) and (pause_short) their
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) fi (pause_medium)
(pause_short) their newsletter
(pause_medium) for the IRAs
(pause_short) We don't have their comprehensive service
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that runs about three hundred dollars a year
(pause_medium) If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance
(pause_medium) the eight hundred number is included
and the f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) So we would drop three hundred dollars off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The account maintenance
(pause_medium) comprehensive account maintenance
(pause_medium) maintenance would cost us five hundred dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) what you do is
(pause_short) they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) he estimates it'd be five hundred dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Banker System charges thirty five dollars (pause_medium) an account
(pause_medium) And he said under a self directed arrangement
(pause_medium) he's seen (pause_medium) charges
(pause_short) to maintain a self directed IRA
(pause_short) anywhere from forty (vocal_noises_inhalation) to a hundred fifty dollars
Now I think a hundred fifty dollars (vocal_noises_inhalation) is a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to maintain a self directed IRA
(pause_short) So you mean
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) that you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's what you're saying
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Well he he thought (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they they d talk in kind of nebulous terms
(vocal_noises_inhalation) w they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they have a minimum (vocal_noises_inhalation) number (pause_short) of accounts
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) Oh
with w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is covered if you will by the five hundred
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yes
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) way I understood it would
(pause_medium) let's say five hundred would would cover the eight hundred
(pause_short) which is very very helpful service
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_medium) the (pause_short) maintenance for let's say twenty accounts
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) if we had (pause_short) ten accounts
(pause_short) we would charge (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) five hundred fifty dollars on ac on an account
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what (pause_short) what that would (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I think it would be good for (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) the five or six of us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to
(pause_medium) to have Galino down here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) can kind of explain what products
(pause_medium) we can offer from the bank side
(pause_medium) Hm
and (pause_short) and we all need to know that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(pause_medium) we can figure out how Matt's
(pause_medium) the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that
(pause_medium) And it's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I was thinking of sending Matt up there for a week
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you know he's up there a week
he's gonna learn a lot of very technical (pause_short) information
such as like those section four fifteen (vocal_noises_inhalation) XSes
(pause_short) That (pause_short) that I was talking about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You really don't need to know the (vocal_noises_inhalation) the technical (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
nitty gritty (pause_medium) about it
(pause_short) because
(pause_medium) that's what Bankers Systems does
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's gonna be less expensive
(pause_short) to have (pause_medium) Galino come here
(pause_medium) instead of one person going up to (pause_short) to Minnesota for a week
(pause_medium) and then trying to bring back the information
(pause_medium) we're gonna have Galino come down here for a day
(pause_medium) and
he won't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) he won't touch any (vocal_noises_inhalation) specific (pause_short) complicated (pause_short) items
(pause_short) Such as four fifteen XSes or
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or ACP testing or that
(pause_medium) Cause Vivian and I kind of know that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but if we don't know that
like that four fifteen (pause_short) (uh) XS
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I called the eight hundred number
and (pause_short) and they went through the explanation
where the IRS (vocal_noises_inhalation) changed (pause_medium) the the deduction
(pause_medium) Just a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Just a (pause_medium) question
(pause_medium) from a mechanics
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Who's gonna hold the account
(pause_short) Is LCL (pause_medium) gonna hold the account
is the bank gonna (pause_medium) ho (pause_medium) hold the account
(pause_short) Who act (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know
and (pause_short) and LCL products
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if you will
held (vocal_noises_inhalation) the account
(pause_short) That that's physically where it was
Is (vocal_noises_inhalation) is it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) is the plan (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) gonna be in the bank
or is the plan (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) just kind of nebulous
(pause_medium) Well (pause_medium)
(pause_short) well the (pause_short) the SEP and the IRA
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will will be First National Bank of Hillsdale
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) That's what I meant
But (pause_short) but tho those (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) if you will
(pause_short) We offer those
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then LCL
if (pause_short) will have
(pause_medium) within that plan
(pause_medium) If you don't want a CD
Tha the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you could direct that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that the monies be used to buy (pause_medium) some mutual fund
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we would get (pause_medium) the (pause_short) statement (pause_short) from LCL
(pause_short) for the (pause_short) mutual fund holdings
(vocal_noises_inhalation) let's say the person also had a CD
Let's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then (pause_short) then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) what what we would have to do is
(pause_short) pull that information together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We would get LCL's statement
(pause_medium) as of (pause_short) the end of the year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and what the balance was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) pull that in
we would report that (vocal_noises_inhalation) up to Bankers Systems
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they would then combine that
(pause_short) and produce the report
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's why there's (pause_short) normally a cost in those self directed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because
(pause_medium) it's not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) with our CDs now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that information
(pause_short) that's the whole account
(pause_short) and whatever's out there on the (pause_short) on the retire
(vocal_noises_inhalation) just passes right up
(pause_medium) and (pause_short) and the CD and the RAP information
r retirement account (pause_medium) processing system talk together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When you get another vendor in here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we physically have to put the papers together
S (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I got a f (pause_medium)
Oh (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) I love (pause_medium) expansions of business
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) The phone number by the way is
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) five five (pause_short) five five POUND
(pause_medium) Is what the phone number will be
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But
(pause_short) this is (pause_short) things that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm I'm (pause_short) anxious for Matt to get here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I'm getting tuckered out
trying to (pause_short) get all these nitty gritty things
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in order to or (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) have business cards
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) LCL in in Chicago needs that
(pause_short) to get that process going
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh is there LCL accounts gonna be maintained here
cause cause actually (pause_medium)
or (pause_short) is there gonna be a separate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're gonna have an account in Chicago
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is that (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) w (pause_short) what we'll do is
(pause_medium) those'll probably wire transfer out
(pause_short) through the Fed
what (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think what will happen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but we (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Matt'll find this out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I'm (pause_medium)
I'm not (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) whichever way it goes is fine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will be
(vocal_noises_inhalation) everyone who makes (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) who buys a fund
(pause_medium) that money will go into a (pause_short) a clearing account here
(pause_medium) And then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we will
(pause_medium) either LCL will (pause_short) will ACH it (pause_short) out of us
(pause_short) Or
(pause_medium) we'll physically wire it up there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You know (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
there may be (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) a hundred thousand dollars in there
which may represent (pause_medium) three people's
or four people's (pause_short) purchases
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL
(pause_medium) and they do the suitability testing
(pause_medium) and then they know (pause_medium) what products have been bought
(pause_medium) and then on the other side
(pause_short) we do a wire transfer
(pause_short) to physically get the money up there
Si (pause_short) similar to Fannie Mae
(pause_short) Ex ex (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Uh yes
We we (pause_short) we collect monies
(pause_short) and then
(pause_medium) we tell them how much of it is theirs
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) by calling up there
and then it (pause_short) they zap it the next day
(pause_short) I don't know if
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) like
(pause_short) that's the same way that (uh) (pause_medium) American Express with the traveler's checks work
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When we sell Traveler's Checks
(pause_short) we put that money in a clearing account
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then Jo Anne
(vocal_noises_inhalation) whosever doing that job
(pause_short) calls (vocal_noises_inhalation) a number
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) we report
(pause_short) how much (pause_short) in (vocal_noises_inhalation) sales we had
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they d (pause_medium) hit the account the next day and take the money out
But that's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's kind of the (pause_short) the mechanics of the (pause_short) of the flow of funds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) LCL
(pause_short) that office (pause_short) will (pause_short) not say First National Bank of Hillsdale
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) or anything of the nature
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) his (vocal_noises_inhalation) his card will be LCL investments
(vocal_noises_inhalation) at First National Bank of Hillsdale
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) letterhead will be LCL
(pause_medium) there needs to be a (pause_short) separate phone line
(pause_medium) POUND going (pause_short) to that office POUND
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And we'll (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the receptionist will also answer it
(pause_short) but when they pick up the phone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know we'll put it on a red line
or (pause_short) blue line or something like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when they pick up that line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know they (pause_short) they pick up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it's also requirements by (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh) I guess NASDAQ or whomever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the comptroller that
(pause_short) they don't (pause_short) want us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when that line rings
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q oh yeah
you do have LCL (vocal_noises_inhalation) in investments Q
They (vocal_noises_inhalation) they talk about in the regulation
and I'm pretty confident they'll (pause_short) they'll implement those out
Is Matt gonna carry on (pause_short) his (pause_medium) other livelihood that he had before
(pause_medium) through that office
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is he totally out of the insurance business
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He was meeting with (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he was going to (pause_short) to tell him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that
(pause_short) he's plans to take a job here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) C Common courtesy says
that he (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) needs to give em two weeks notice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But
(pause_short) the (pause_short) the practice within the (pause_short) the industry
and Larry (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Matt said this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) I know it's not (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Matt's employer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I've decided to move on to another (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) another (uh) (pause_short) (uh) (pause_medium) customer
or an another (pause_short) employer
(pause_short) ni (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) N (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I'll g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) see if she's gonna be
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Or else I'll give her a call tomorrow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) they typically say well fine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) thanks for the two weeks notice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then they electronically (pause_medium) transfer (pause_short) his licenses
(pause_short) to his (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to to LCL
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a good slide show
(pause_short) Too bad you can't make it
(pause_medium) (TSK) Who else do you know that's been there besides (pause_short) what's her name
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Just Jessie and Shana
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanna go
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Hunh
(pause_short) I'd like to go
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's an interesting thing though
(um)
(pause_medium) you know
since it is such (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) m
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's restricted
(pause_medium) (TSK) No
Isn't Nicara gua one of the things you (pause_medium)
we have (pause_medium)
We have f f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Technically speaking
(pause_short) full (pause_short) diplomatic re lations with Nicaragua
(pause_short) you know an American ambassador there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I (pause_medium)
who (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like a nest of CIA spies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's just (pause_medium)
there (pause_medium)
but there n (pause_medium)
but I thought it w (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's not like going to Cuba
(pause_short) Where they have to make connections through Mexico because
(H) But I won der whether this (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) It is
(pause_medium) how long (pause_medium)
how long's (pause_medium)
they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and and I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) For a few years
There's quite a few pla (pause_medium)
(TSK) (pause_short) There's only a (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) there's only a handful of places
How long has it been illegal for Americans to (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
Since the fif (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
from like the (pause_short) time of Cath (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the Castro revolution
(vocal_noises_inhalation) overturned (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) travel restrictions
on the (um)
(pause_short) (TSK) on the passport
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and said that the government couldn't
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) really
(pause_medium) permit you from going anywh (pause_medium)
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) tha (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to do (um)
(pause_short) visa res (pause_short) restrictions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think Cuba
(pause_short) Now Leba non
(pause_medium) Unhunh
(pause_short) are the only places that (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) maybe North (pause_medium)
(pause_short) maybe Vietnam also
(pause_short) you're
(pause_short) supposedly
(pause_short) but
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you really
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They know

(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I give her a qu swift kick into the LA river
How could you abandon her about twenty y (pause_medium)

XXX (pause_short) (H)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
watching it like (pause_short) go like
like pick (pause_short) goop off the bottom
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
the thing it (uh) will actually be half swimming
They d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then the
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) flutters around the tank trying to get away from him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I don't have the heart for that kind of thing
(vocal_noises_laughter) when you say it that way
I don't think I could stand it eith (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well you know what I was doing
(pause_short) I would once a week
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Tuesday
(pause_short) we we named it Sissy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like right in front of all the kids
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I would get buy a feeder locally
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I would put it in the little thing
(pause_short) hunt
(pause_medium) you know
we would watch Sissy hunt (pause_short) the goldfish
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And the go (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and t was so h (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) HI Yeah HI
(pause_short) It would l eat only live things
(pause_short) Th that's the only way they feed
Yeah they won't eat (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
some k (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) eat dead things
and then it would (pause_medium)
(pause_short) cause it'll only eat it live
(pause_medium) you know
and then the snake would start to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it would start to do this whole little dance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then it would start s (pause_medium)
it would start (pause_medium) moving
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) at the same pace that the snake would b (pause_medium)
(pause_short) kinda following it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It would be like this little whirlwind
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And all of a sudden it would go (pause_short) chk
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know what's so funny
(pause_medium) The snake
(pause_medium) was v (pause_medium)
th they're v (pause_medium)
they're very b (pause_medium)
th (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause it
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) it would rarely get the fish
it w (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then the fins would all get (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (um)
(pause_medium) the kids loved it
(pause_medium) Well
They lo (pause_medium)
and (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I had one little girl
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she was this sensitive sweet little girl from (uh) Guatemala
Who was (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And every time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She she did (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) She crossed herself
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for the fish
(pause_short) For the Fish
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I asked her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_short) from that point (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then from that point on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) everybody would be sitting there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) looking at the fish anxiously
and I would have to (pause_short) tell em to sit down
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) others can't see
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) She
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) would turn around
(pause_medium) Well
And she was (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know i
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she no
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) She was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) What was so funny is
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) about it
And (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Y (pause_medium)
the snake (pause_medium)
Sissy s (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) MRC ate the fish MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and Ana cried
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
That was like their (pause_medium)
and it was really fu (pause_medium)
they'd (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they'd do their sentences
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (um) crying
(pause_medium) And what did she write
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) U m
(vocal_noises_laughter) Sissy ate the fish and I cried (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (Hx)
Ki (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I wouldn't (pause_medium)
I'd (pause_medium)
I would have it from (pause_short) the morning
or I'd pick it up the n (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's what I'd do
if it w (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would pick it up Monday
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I would take it home
(pause_medium) And that was the worst part
(pause_short) and I would like put it in
I would leave it in its (pause_short) plastic bag
(vocal_noises_inhalation) put it in a bunch of water
(pause_short) I didn't wanna get friendly with this fish
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then I would take it in
and I would put it in a (pause_short) paper bag
(pause_short) And so I wouldn't look at it
(pause_short) And I would put it like over by the sink in the classroom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Only when it was put into the bowl
(pause_medium) it was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was the worst
You didn't wanna get (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Listen to her
it was really (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
is not (pause_short) as (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember once
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(SNIFF)
(pause_short) go to an elementary school
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) right around the corner from it
(pause_medium) (TSK) Anyway
(um)
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) (TSK) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
Where was y el (pause_medium)
(pause_short) where (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And there's all those little shops
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
On Hol (pause_medium)
(pause_short) On Vermont
(pause_short) like w maybe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) six shops up from
from (uh) (pause_short) um
(pause_medium) rather
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
there was (pause_short) a little pet shop called Pandora's Pets
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(SNIFF) WH (vocal_noises_laughter) Pandor's pets (vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they had this fish in there called an Oscar
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they are these like
(pause_short) they are these really
(pause_short) They're these big gnarly suckers
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They're like m (pause_medium)
f (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they only eat like other fish
(SNIFF)
(pause_medium) you know like goldfish
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Poor guys
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're like the
(vocal_noises_inhalation) anyway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) anyway so
in every pet shop (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember w watching them feed the Oscar once
(pause_medium) (TSK) And they dropped in the goldfish
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But this time particularly sticks in my mind
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He drops the goldfish into the tank
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the Oscar sneaks up behind it
And like creates a vacuum (pause_short) kinda thing cause
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you got this huge mouth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Yeah (pause_short) and
(pause_short) and then
And it doesn't even XX XX (pause_medium)
and then (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But the goldfish got stuck
(pause_short) MRC half way into his mou th MRC
(pause_short) Mouth first
(pause_short) Well it was going
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's the problem
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Anyway
(H) (pause_short) (TSK) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you got this Oscar there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) a goldfish
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) the (pause_short) the head of a goldfish
(pause_short) bloop
(pause_short) bloop
(pause_short) bloop VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the Oscar's there swimming around
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) VOX massively expressive faces VOX
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
HI but I think it was (vocal_noises_laughter) worried
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it g it's going
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was just imagining what was going through its little mind
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (H)
frantically trying to (vocal_noises_inhalation) dislodge it
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And um HI
(pause_medium) finally it d did manage to
v like (pause_short) loosen it
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I don't know remember if it spat it out or
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or what
But it managed to like (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) dis lodge it
(pause_medium) Well (pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) I (pause_short) wanted to say I'm really happy with the stuff (pause_medium) I got now
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Good
(H) And I'm really basically I'm back for a tape deck
(pause_medium) Oh ok ay
So (pause_short) um
(pause_short) one of my thoughts is
(pause_medium) that (pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) well
(pause_medium) I want a tape deck (pause_short) that's gonna sound about
(pause_medium) you know
and I think I want a tape deck with two (pause_medium)
(pause_short) places for two tapes
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but I've never done this before
I mean I h (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I have a (pause_medium) boombox
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) I wonder if you would (pause_short) suggest that this (pause_short) Luxman (pause_medium) is the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) is w one of the things you'd wanted me to think about
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) the (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)() (TSK) (pause_medium) Would you (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)() you would want the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the ability
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) of the double cassette deck
(pause_medium) just purely for (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) taping from one tape to the other
(pause_medium) That's its main purpose
(pause_short) In fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it (pause_short) _would have
(pause_short) is if
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you can load up two tapes in it
(pause_medium) like
(pause_short) I see
(pause_medium) where it will continually play
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) all four sides
(pause_medium) That's probably not gonna hap pen
(pause_short) It's mainly for copying
(pause_medium) (TSK) Okay
(pause_short) And the tapes you'd be copying
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) are they gonna be straight music
(pause_medium) Mmostly
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) or desire a pretty (pause_short) decent
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) copy of your original tape
(pause_medium) right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) And the originals will be from music lovers
(pause_short) who probably have
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) pretty good systems
(pause_short) Not (pause_medium)
I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) P But P (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Anyway
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium)() because on a
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) a tape deck like that
(pause_medium) you realize
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the original sour ce was
(pause_short) or even as that tape was
(pause_short) mhm
(pause_medium) mhm
(pause_short) in the generation of making that copy
(pause_short) (TSK)
(H) And (pause_medium)
I mean how (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_medium) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you're you're gonna have that loss
(pause_short) just (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) because of all the different things involved
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) taking it from one tape
(pause_short) and putting it on the other tape
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
So you're (pause_short) you're bound to lose something
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) It's not huge
(pause_medium) Right
(H) (pause_short) Uh which is a small amount
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) (TSK) you'll st (pause_medium) still (pause_medium) be able to enjoy the (COUGH) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the music
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and the message it's trying to (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) bring across
(pause_short) mhm
(pause_short) okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) the other thing I realize is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) think about how much of the time you're gonna be doing that
(pause_medium) Mhm
Because of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You are paying a decent premium
(pause_short) to have that conve nience
(pause_medium) mhm
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so what kind of price difference are we talking about
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And let my friends copy tapes for me and
(pause_medium) like let's say there would be about
(pause_medium) um (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) couple different steps
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) a single cassette deck
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_short) that would
(pause_medium) (TSK) (uh)
(pause_medium) play the tape (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And Luxman has a great cassette deck
(pause_short) to fill (pause_medium) those needs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And um
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) all of their cassette decks come with a five year parts and labor warranty (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) put into them
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) They really put a lot into them
(pause_medium) (TSK) they're pretty conservative in their
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) specifications
(pause_medium) what they say their cassette decks will do
(pause_medium) they will (pause_medium) y usually out perform that
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all the units
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) go along with that
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) as far as the remote control funtions go
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The decks come with
(pause_short) what's called a DIN cable
(pause_medium) and that plugs in to the unit you have now
(pause_short) right
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) (TSK) This would be
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to integrate into your system
(pause_short) okay
(pause_short) (TSK) (pause_short) this gives you
(pause_medium) a lot of pluses that
(pause_short) most people's basic decks don't have
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) without cutting the high frequencies
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) regular Dolby is Dolby B
(pause_medium) That's like um
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) when you buy tapes at the Wherehouse
(pause_short) they're (pause_short) in Dolby
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(TSK) (pause_medium) in addition to that it gives you Dolby C
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When you're making your own tapes at home
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Um
(pause_short) Dolby C
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You don't want to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) mix and match
(pause_medium) the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It doesn't sound quite right
(pause_medium) Nkay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So this gives you that
(pause_medium) mhm
(pause_short) r h
(pause_medium) really expensive cassette decks
(pause_short) Hm
(H) And that i (pause_short) is
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) an improvement in the recording section of it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it allows you to record a little bit
(pause_short) so you hear less tape hiss
(pause_short) um
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) hm
(pause_short) M hm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_short) um
(pause_short) (TSK) (pause_short) from there
(pause_medium) the next step
(pause_medium) for what you're looking at
(vocal_noises_inhalation) would be the kay one ten
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on the on the kay one eleven
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with the addition of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the convenience feature of having auto reverse
(pause_short) Yeah
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's nice
(pause_short) Where
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it will play (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) side B
(pause_short) automatically
(pause_medium) Where you don't have to get up and flip the tape
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The other thing about it is
you can flip the tape over at any point (pause_medium) in the middle
(pause_medium) right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) the other thing
(pause_medium) y let's say if you're entertaining
(pause_short) you can put in a ninety minute tape
(pause_short) put it on continuous auto reverse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_medium) play side A
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so that's what it gives you in the kay one ten
(pause_medium) the
(pause_medium) dual
(pause_medium) or double cassette deck
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that Luxman offers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is basically
(pause_medium) a (pause_short) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) double version (pause_short) of the kay one ten
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they call it the kay one ten double u
(pause_short) (TSK) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) And (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the (pause_medium)
the kay one ten (pause_short) is four hundred eighty dollars
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and the kay one ten double u
(pause_medium) okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then you're paying another hundred dollars to have
Yeah (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) double cassette deck that's auto reverse
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Whe re
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) they even have
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) dubbing
(pause_short) or copy ing
(pause_short) mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) so it's really set up
(pause_short) to be (pause_short) just cranking out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) copies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now the other thing is
(pause_short) it has a feature where it will do it in half the time
(pause_medium) Or high speed dubbing
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Which is sometimes nice
(pause_short) so it doesn't take the whole period of time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) To make your copy
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) so we (pause_medium)
how (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) a high speed copy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The other thing that sets this apart
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) for each cassette deck
(pause_medium) (STIFLED_SNEEZE) (pause_short) Mhm
Ge (pause_medium)
(uh) (pause_short) gesundheit
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) Thank you
(pause_short) (SNIFF) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) yeah
(pause_medium) where a lot of units will
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) just have a Dolby setting
(pause_short) Mhm
made (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you wanna record it in Dolby B
(pause_short) and in your automobi le's cassette player
(pause_short) mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) in that scenario
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you're gonna want to play it back in Dolby C
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Okay
(SNIFF) (pause_short) Nkay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you had your prize tape
(pause_medium) mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) put it on continuous
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) unhunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) auto reverse
(pause_short) and it will play side A side B of one tape
(pause_medium) go over to the other tape
and play sed ai (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) side A
(pause_short) then side B
(pause_short) and it con tinually go forever
(pause_medium) O kay
(pause_medium) Hunh
(pause_medium) (TSK) which is kinda nice
(pause_short) Now the other thing you can do with this deck (pause_short) is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in your system
(pause_medium) you can make a copy
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) while you're listening to something else
(pause_medium) n kay
(pause_short) O kay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the other thing you can do is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) as I recall (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) one can listen to (pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the tuner
(pause_medium) so you could put on (H) KDB
or I (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) r there's one Matt likes
(pause_short) I forget what it's called (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) but anyhow
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(H) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) Which is kind of tough
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so you could be listening to the radio
(pause_medium) while taping a CD
(pause_medium) You you know
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Which
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you have to pay attention to (vocal_noises_laughter) what you're doing (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but at least you have that flexibili ty
from (pause_medium) what you've told me
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) good quality copies of tapes
(pause_short) mhm
(pause_short) (TSK) And integrate well with your system
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) I actually (pause_medium) may
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) And it may well be that I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I'd do better
(pause_short) just going back to one of these others
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) in (pause_medium)
(TSK)(vocal_noises_inhalation) The oth (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in fact
I'm (pause_medium)
the oth (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the other thing I was gonna say is
is it (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) do you have
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) if you had some other type of quality cassette deck
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Even if it was a
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (H) unf (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) one in the office
or (uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I could somehow hook it up into your system
(pause_medium) mhm
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) one of these
(pause_short) okay
(pause_short) that's possible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the (pause_medium)
(uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) since you've bought ouple pieces here
(pause_short) I'm sure we can (vocal_noises_inhalation) work something else out for you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) how well (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) h
(pause_medium) let's see here
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) the kay one eleven
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) which is the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) but (pause_short) h
(pause_short) I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) When I say basic
(pause_short) I mean basic in their line
(H) (uh)
(pause_short) you'd be looking at three hundred forty nine dollars
(pause_short) nkay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) The
(uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) let's see here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the kay one ten
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) we could do four hundred (pause_short) and forty five
(TSK) (pause_short) right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and the kay one ten double u
(pause_medium) (uh) we could do five thirty nine
(pause_medium) mhm
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) And I th (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I believe
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's one that we didn't talk about
(pause_short) M hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
and the kay one twelve is basically (vocal_noises_inhalation) the audiophile's dream cassette deck
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) O kay
it's a (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's a single cassette
(pause_short) and it's single direction
(pause_short) right
(pause_medium) hunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and this will make a superior tape copy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) or a superior tape period
(vocal_noises_inhalation) U m
(pause_medium) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And what it does
(pause_short) a separate head for play
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (TSK) Un hunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) (uh) such as bias fine trim
(pause_short) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) tailor (pause_short) the cassette deck's electronics
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to the specific tape you're using
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So obviously you can see there's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) a b (pause_medium)
a bit more (vocal_noises_laughter) invol ved with it
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For the purist
(pause_medium) this is the way to go
(pause_short) Here you're looking at six hundred dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Let me ask you one other thing
(pause_short) Suppose that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanna use this tape deck
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_short) conversation
Like we do in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Between Matt and me
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) how does it work
(pause_short) Let's say go back to the kay one ten
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
Or the one (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Let's take a look here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The kay one ten
(pause_medium) Mhm
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) has provisions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you can plug in one microphone
(pause_medium) Yeah
(TSK) (uh)
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) Mh hunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it will record it on both tracks of it
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it senses when you plug in the second mic
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then it has a record level on it
(pause_short) mhm
(H) (pause_short) and then also the type of tape you're using
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_medium) (TSK) Uh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so the kay one ten would be set up for that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Any of the other
(um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) the kay one eleven has it too
I Take (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Huh
(pause_medium) unhunh
(H) Okay it's the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it's the dual one that doesn't
(pause_short) okay
(pause_medium) The dual one does not have those provisions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) now that doesn't mean that it cannot be done
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What has to happen then is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) one (pause_short) (TSK) hooks up (vocal_noises_inhalation) a
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then it plugs into your receiver
(pause_short) um
(um)
(pause_medium) nkay
(pause_medium) into your tape deck
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (um)
(pause_medium) m
(pause_medium) which is the single auto reverse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the kay one eleven (vocal_noises_inhalation) has the mic provisions
And so's the kay one (pause_medium)
(pause_short) O kay
The b (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The big benefit is the auto re verse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) I'm one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse
The first time (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And for some reason
(pause_medium) maybe (vocal_noises_laughter) I just have to learn
when I (vocal_noises_laughter) put the tape in
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So I have a hard time finding (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The way it usually works is
(H) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
the side of the tape that's (pause_short) out
(pause_medium) that label side
(pause_short) mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) corresponds with the arrow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that will point to the right
(pause_short) There's usually two little arrows that will light up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay the arrow that points to the right
(pause_medium) I see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the label (pause_short) side of the tape that's facing you
(pause_short) O kay
(pause_medium) Okay that's the way it usually works
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now the other thing that throws people off is
(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) fast forward and rewind
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) will (pause_medium) vary
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) all the time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I just (um)
(pause_short) I'll (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'll work on getting used to that
(pause_short) But I just might go with the (vocal_noises_inhalation) single (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
the one (vocal_noises_laughter) that I have to turn it over
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I'm trying (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I mean I had a couple recently
(uh)
(uh)
(pause_medium) got the kay one eleven
and (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and they love it
(pause_short) too
(pause_short) I'm really in to CD's now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then I think they even have a couple books on tape
(pause_short) it's probably w (pause_short) more than enough
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
I really think those are the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that's the big difference
this is (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) SING doo doo SING
(pause_medium) I believe
(pause_medium) yeah
(pause_short) I think that's the basic difference
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Here
(pause_short) Uh
(pause_short) we don't really
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we are
(pause_medium) Okay
(H) And so we (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we've gotten them for clients time to time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think we have them available from Sony
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) I'd really have to l research that a bit for you
I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) sort of (um)
(pause_short) table (pause_short) mic (pause_short) would cost
(pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) um (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
f (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) ah s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I would say
(pause_medium) I would expect to pay
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) the sky's the limit with microphones
n (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) thousand dollar microphone s
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) you would proba (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I would spend
(pause_medium) you know I wouldn't spend nineteen dollar s
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(pause_short) maybe a little up above that
I (pause_short) I don't ever see paying
that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that would probably be
(pause_medium) right
(pause_medium) So that kind of gives you an idea
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) called Sound Advice
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Al right
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) He's (uh)
(pause_short) Wayne
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) Saybeck Shaybeck
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) and they're good guys there
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) So that would be
(pause_medium) that'd be great
(pause_short) Yeah
(H) (pause_medium) Um
(THROAT) if we needed to d get a price on a (pause_medium) tape r recorder
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
Are y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
But (pause_medium)
(pause_short) considered
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean there's a lot of different models of Uhers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but (uh)
(pause_short) they've always been considered
(vocal_noises_inhalation) probably one of the finest portable cassette recorders
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) (pause_medium) w
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) So I could show you (vocal_noises_inhalation) what the blue book price was
Then (pause_short) if I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's gonna be hard to d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it's gonna be hard to determine
what would be a comparable (vocal_noises_inhalation) replacement to day
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Great
(pause_medium) Nkay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You don't sell that kind of thing here
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_medium) to tell you the truth
(pause_medium) okay
(pause_medium) But (uh)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) overall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is great
What I think I'll do is (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) take these ideas back to Matt
(pause_medium) then yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's the auto rev (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we have in stock
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The kay one eleven
(pause_short) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but we're gonna be placing a Luxman order soon
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you couldn't call me up and then listen to a tape that night
(pause_short) That's fine
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) but
(pause_short) we're talking like maybe a week or some thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) I'm not that (uh) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) th SM the timing isn't that tight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) no
(pause_short) Um
(pause_short) Pete had told me Matt came by
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I th guess the l (pause_medium) l (pause_medium)
y (pause_short) we were talking a bout
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) there was an article on (uh)
So (pause_medium)
Do you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) had you heard anything
(pause_short) ha has he (pause_short) read that and he's thinking (pause_medium)
thinking (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you talked about this with him
un (pause_medium)
(pause_short) under the roof and everyth
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) cause you know
(pause_short) You can't have that stuff showing
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
Not (pause_short) where we are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_medium) Coming along
(pause_short) putting the (uh)
(pause_short) specs out for bids
(pause_medium) That's progress
that's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We're gonna have
(pause_short) Exactly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (um)
(pause_short) but X (pause_medium)
(pause_short) then if you sit up at night thinking
Then (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) should we go for him
(vocal_noises_laughter) I know it (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just what I was telling Jeff
I said we got all these places in the (pause_short) (SNIFF) specs
where we're (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) we're having to say
(pause_medium) K (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Figure this one separately
cause we (vocal_noises_laughter) may have to axe it
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (pause_short) biting (vocal_noises_laughter) our nails
Th (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe (uh)
(pause_medium) anyway
(pause_medium) be a lot less than you thought
(pause_medium) Like windows aren't as expensive as I thought
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) double glazed up there now
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) Yeah
which some t (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (um)
And I (pause_medium)
I can (pause_medium)
h no you're (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah that's what I had looked at
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think
(pause_medium) is w (pause_medium)
You don't have the (pause_medium)
I have the d the (pause_medium)
the double one here (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(um)
(pause_short) single one
(pause_short) Okay
The other t (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the other
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the single auto reverse
(pause_short) I have in stock
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) Good
(pause_medium) Thanks so much
(pause_short) Good
but I bet (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I bet it's been worse than that before
It's (pause_medium)
it's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Good
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I think you've got another sale
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_short) (TSK) yeah
(pause_medium) And even if I go out and ask for it
(pause_short) I won't feel guilty
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I really won't (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) It's just a set of instructions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a little bit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) those guys have so much fun writing those programs
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) that's the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I think that's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that's pretty (pause_medium)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah well
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) That's pretty much the end of it
(pause_short) And that's pretty much the end of the truthful part of the process
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The rest of it is all marketing
(pause_short) Hm
and the marketplace is (uh)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) maybe I think I live in Tangiers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) Maybe I think the marketplace is (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you get what you can get
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) Uh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) seems to be that way
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but just throwing my money out there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Heavens yes
(pause_short) You know
I mean it (pause_short) happens all over the place
(uh)
(pause_short) whose voice they used in the (pause_short) telephone
(pause_medium) the number has been changed
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that I had (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that lady
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Q the number you have reached
(pause_short) Hunh
(pause_short) When she th tried to do that
(pause_medium) hunh
(pause_medium) they certainly use her a lot
(pause_medium) But I mean it (pause_medium)
a s (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
it's a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) to say every possible combination
(vocal_noises_inhalation) oh but
they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and the computer
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) it's like a series of samples
(pause_short) And it automatically sorts em
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so it's
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Probably the total actual (pause_short) s speaking that they use
(pause_medium) It would be much more pleasant if they had done all the combinations though
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) You know
and there's something that actually (pause_short) says your number
(pause_short) in toto
(pause_short) You know (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
and (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Q Thank you Mister Smith

(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) well the networking of computers is getting (uh) such that
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) (TSK) almost anything's possible
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Any XX (pause_medium)
that's why I (pause_short) like it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) just
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
could be like (pause_short) last year
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(H) It's like a r (pause_medium)
(Hx)
(pause_medium) and it's communication like books
(pause_medium) And it's like
but when they get (pause_medium)
you can (pause_short) make it happen
(pause_medium) If it just about information
(pause_short) I mean you can't (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If it's just about information
(pause_short) You can't conjure something up
(pause_medium) like a car out of nothing
(pause_short) But
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) that's gonna make it
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) mhm
(pause_short) to have
(pause_short) all the electronic
(pause_short) this and that that they want
(pause_short) (TSK) Yeah
(pause_short) And it'll be small
You know and it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It'll be f so small
that we'll have enormous amount (pause_medium)
(uh) (pause_medium)
we should have an enormous (pause_medium) supply of it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) yeah like
(pause_short) Basically
(pause_medium) cheap as a switch these days or something
ky (pause_medium)
and it (pause_medium)
and start growing this (pause_short) thi those (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) silicon chips without any flaws
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they'll be able to (uh)
(pause_short) grow circuitry that is so complicated
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) that gravity destroys it
so they'll be able to (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) uh
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) to (pause_medium)
i they'll be able to get these fantastic (uh) circuits
(vocal_noises_inhalation) f like say for a whole television set
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) a (pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) is so sensational
(pause_medium) (TSK) That'll be expensive at first
(pause_medium) God
But can you (pause_medium)
it'll (pause_medium)
it'll (uh)
(pause_medium) it'll be worth it
In (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) This technology out of most of
(pause_short) (uh) m
(pause_short) anything in the past
ha has m (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) it's becoming like we're shaping our (pause_medium) our destiny
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) with this technology
more than we have in (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) with any other in the past
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) just b_like
whatever we think it b (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we can (pause_short) make it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but there's one technology that's um
(pause_short) gonna overtake that
(pause_short) which is
(pause_short) bombarding (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) rganisms with radiation
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) But once we do
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we'll be able to program biology as well
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) Well that's pretty frightening con cept
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It is frightening but
(pause_short) We can't even control our freeways
(um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I know
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
i (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Once it's out there in the open
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
the (pause_medium)
Well I hope (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Are you familiar with fractals
(pause_short) Yeah
Be cause f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) No
can be found k (pause_medium)
(uh)
than it can with (uh) regular mathematics
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and religion and
(pause_short) and and and bio logy
ar (pause_medium)
and the (pause_medium)
and the sci (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Pardon
it was just (pause_medium) a branch of knowledge
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Unhunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) yeah
(H)
The the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the totality is taken into account
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as opposed to the observer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember
(pause_short) kind of a crusade
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) for scientific (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) responsibility
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And scientists are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) are taking such control over the world these days
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) with their n
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And the way it's marketed
and the way we're d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we develop needs for it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I remember this pf cartoon I saw w
(pause_short) of
(pause_short) of
(pause_short) it was called The Scientist
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it had this
(pause_short) this wonderful stone statue
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) intertwined with each other
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then they s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they they looked like they were so intertwined
(pause_short) and they're a s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they're a statue
(vocal_noises_inhalation) right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the whole base of the statue is crumbling
(pause_medium) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it's just like rubble
(pause_short) just below the knees
(vocal_noises_inhalation) down
a few ttle (pause_medium)
(pause_short) some of it was chipped off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) this rubble
(pause_short) was this little man
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who was a scientist
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he was looking at the rubble
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but looking down at the crumbs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) at the rubble at the bottom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) to me that
(pause_short) that always symbolized
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the limitations of the scientific method
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Whi (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) well
(pause_short) the (pause_short) to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the the the whole human experience
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) including
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) the (pause_short) unbelievable parts of it
(pause_short) the parts that are just legend
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and (uh)
(pause_short) alluded to
and the (vocal_noises_inhalation) subjec tive
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
you know they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) you can't
(pause_medium) (TSK) And science is a microscope
(pause_medium) Each (pause_short) p_scientist has their
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) their field of (um)
(pause_medium) expertise
(pause_short) and if they're gonna go
(pause_short) if they're gonna stretch out far enough into the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the unknown
(pause_short) where they can find something new
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They have to do it in a straight line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in all directions at once
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So the problem is communication between s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they're doing it with mathematics
(pause_medium) I mean
n (pause_short) no
(pause_short) but the comm
(pause_short) problem is
(pause_short) communication between the branches of science
(pause_short) mhm
(pause_short) (TSK) that's true
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who's gonna (pause_short) be able to hold
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) f the stuff can be understand
(pause_short) understood
(pause_medium) The goals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Those people can tell you
(pause_short) or the cutting (pause_medium)
can be understand (pause_medium)
(pause_short) understood intellectually
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) they know the whole structure
well the (pause_medium)
and somebody looking at the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) A nd you gotta have somebody
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who's guiding
(pause_short) and make all the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and (uh)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) I think
(pause_medium) I think that
(pause_short) one of the reasons that there's been no focus is because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) h
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And was kinda letting the scientific method be the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) be the leader
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The (pause_medium)
(pause_short) just continue inventorying and
(pause_short) continue inventorying
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium)(TSK) documenting
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) instead of (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh) coming at it from another direction
(pause_short) trying to find
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) trying to find ways to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to
like (pause_short) with (pause_short) with Einstein for example
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
he was trying to f (pause_medium)
T_he was ex (pause_short) per (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with new ways of doing things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) h (pause_medium)
(uh) and thinking about things
and he was trying to (pause_medium)
he w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) trying to discover the speed of his own thought
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) he was like
that were all based in a peaceful (pause_medium) world
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that couldn't exist unless he was secure
or that (pause_short) that (pause_short) peace (pause_short) was (vocal_noises_inhalation) part of it
Of (pause_medium) what he was (pause_short) about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so much of today's technology is soulless
(vocal_noises_inhalation) just generally
(pause_short) chewing up
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) chewing up (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) ch n (pause_medium)
j chewing up (pause_short) new w (pause_medium)
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some kind of consumer need
(pause_short) Did you ever get into Tesla
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) He had a lot of real (pause_short) wacky ideas on (pause_short) big levels
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that you could (um)
(pause_medium) tap into the air basically
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and (um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) y (pause_medium)
(pause_short) but
(pause_short) it (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it interfered with (um)
(SWALLOW) (pause_medium) well
(vocal_noises_laughter) I mean
y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) it wasn't really a very efficient either
(pause_short) Because you'd have to have a (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) an immense amount of power being broadcast
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
if they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) I don't know
(pause_short) He was dealing with it being (pause_medium) basically energy
(uh) you know
(pause_short) yeah
which doesn't really (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) require a conductor
yeah may (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I think he was
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean he va basically invented the radio
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and stuff like that
you know (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's pretty confusing to me (vocal_noises_exhalation)
but (uh)
(pause_short) yeah
those (pause_short) those guys are the guys I think that are the heroes
(uh)
(pause_short) that are the unsung heroes
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) the r (pause_medium)
the (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and s (pause_medium)
but business has always (uh)
(pause_medium) taken these works
(pause_short) and manipulated em
(pause_medium) to their benefit
(pause_medium) to our benefit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) wh (pause_short) what the obvious
more immediate econo mic (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it's like
(pause_short) gee
(pause_medium) I mean you just do it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well that's what I like about fractals
is because (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) with these new mathematical (pause_medium) formulas
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) because it's mathematical
and it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I (pause_short) it has to work I guess with (vocal_noises_inhalation) numbers in it
(pause_short) somew some way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) it's opens a door into
(pause_short) what appears to be all the substance that's underneath the obvious
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) You know
with (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) these fractals seem to
(pause_medium) seem to represent
(pause_short) everything that numbers aren't
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh) that's (pause_medium)
but s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) well
it (pause_medium)
like (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) _it's a window
and it's also like a model of (um) (pause_short) reality
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(pause_medium) like a fractal can get really close at do (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yes
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's still n (pause_short) not the totality of a plant
it's the (pause_medium)
it's an opportunity for them to (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to the chaos
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that exists (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) a h as subtext
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and when we're say (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) when we're going to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) say blow up the first atomic bomb
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and and and
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) cause they didn't know for sure
whether (pause_short) it would de stroy the universe or not
(vocal_noises_laughter) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Or not (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It might have started a chain reaction that just blew up the whole earth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it has (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in disharmony
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) in the (pause_short) deterioration of the planet
we're all worried about the (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) th cancer is everywhere
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
it's just that the uni (pause_medium)
it's for (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is just a thin shell from how deep
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this phantasmagorical experience goes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that when they did that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that it'll take a while before it
(pause_short) it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it really
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) vr goes (ROAR)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) it might take
(pause_short) a a few th (pause_medium)
it might take (pause_short) five hundred years
or maybe it's be (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or it might never happen but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that was scientific irresponsibility
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) of f
(pause_short) what fractals symbolize
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with the sci entif (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there might have been a little more caution
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there's this window
but fractals don't (uh)
(pause_short) don't imply any (pause_short) particular morals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well they imply
(pause_short) Well all math does that
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) (uh) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) just another model
(pause_medium) it's
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) to me it's a model
(pause_short) it's (pause_short) it's a model into the fourth dimension
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) actually
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) but fractal can be applied to
(pause_medium) many dimensions or n (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or just
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) taking something and dividing it up randomly
(pause_medium) or
(pause_short) with some system
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's like nested
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) nested values
(pause_medium) basically
(pause_medium) Inside a gallon you have four quarts
inside of four (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in (pause_short) inside a quart you have
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) etcetera etcetera
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) well
I don't (pause_short) see how it's (pause_medium)
it's not (uh)
(pause_short) it's not squared
I mean it's (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's
(pause_short) it's not predictable at all really
(pause_short) It's
(pause_short) it's a it's a found pheno menon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well it's not predictable if you apply random (pause_medium) values to the (pause_medium) subdivisions
(pause_medium) The subdivisions have to be random
(pause_medium) They ha (pause_medium)
it has to (pause_short) have (pause_short) randomness to it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the order
(pause_medium) is understood
(pause_medium) yet
(pause_short) I mean I might be wrong
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) well
(pause_short) they're calling it
(pause_short) the equ (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the mathematics of chaos SMOKING
That's not fractals (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) SMOKING It includes other (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it includes
(pause_short) it i (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I mean
and chaos is se (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) they overlap
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Chaos I guess is basically analysis of noise
(pause_short) For the scientist
the scientist has never hav (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you see
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) see that's w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that's the point that I'm trying to get at
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because the scientific method now has that tool of overlap
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) that is an opportunity for
(pause_short) to meet spirituality
(pause_medium) Yeah well
(pause_short) there's u (pause_medium)
(pause_short) in physics
(vocal_noises_laughter) There's oppor tunities to meet spirituality
(pause_short) twenty four hours a day wherever you go
(vocal_noises_inhalation) just by being alive
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If they don't wanna see it
A lot of people will (uh)
because (pause_short) they (pause_short) follow (pause_short) the scientific impulse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) fractals may (pause_short) be the very thing that boggles them out enough
(pause_medium) is my theory
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Maybe
(pause_short) They'll probably find it in something
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think (um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's like all the (pause_short) the ideas that we have
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they're just sort of echos of (uh)
(pause_short) the past
And they come (pause_medium) under different names and things
Just like (um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the latest power now is corporations
(pause_medium) like (uh) governments
(pause_short) principalities
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) before that it was gangs
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
s but (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) it's unbelievable
and and (pause_short) the pursuit of (um)
(pause_short) spirituality
(pause_medium) has taken on many forms
(pause_medium) And if a person wants to find it in
(pause_short) in something they believe in
(pause_medium) well that's very true
(uh) (pause_medium)
that (pause_medium)
I think that that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that people who find spirituality in science
as their (pause_short) f sole spiritual (vocal_noises_inhalation) source are
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) people that are fucking up the planet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) I don't think science is the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I've been watching Two Thousand And One lately
I mean that's what that's all (pause_medium)
i (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a major theme in it
(pause_short) the race between the human and the
and the tech no (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and its
and its technological (vocal_noises_inhalation) manifestation of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well I (pause_medium)
we built (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is it gonna m (pause_short) do us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is our creation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is our creation going to (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) destroy us
Yeah (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Man delbrot
(pause_short) oh
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) (TSK) I thought they were showing that on the (uh) (pause_short) ads
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Little too hip
(pause_medium) So they're color cycling right now
(pause_medium) Does it zoom later
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_medium) (TSK) and I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) M(TSK) (uh)
(pause_short) This one's Fractal Fantasy
(pause_medium) Hunh
(pause_short) and the other one is (uh)
(pause_medium) Fractal Zooms
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (BURP) b and then I've got a (uh) test film from (pause_short) IBM laboratories
of (uh)
f (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) taking a Julia set into the fourth dimension
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_medium) which th (pause_medium)
it's pretty f (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) be (um)
(pause_medium) back in the barn (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) A little bit of pain in his abdomen
(pause_short) or gastroenteritis
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or what the (pause_medium) problem is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) and sending him home
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) or something in there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (SNIFF) I didn't feel anything in his belly
(pause_medium) (TSK) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they'll just get an upset stomach
(pause_short) and
(um)
also a little bit of (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) well
just inflamation in (pause_short) in there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and and just feel bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(um)
(pause_medium) I
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) how he does
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any (pause_medium) any infection
(pause_medium) that he
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) or if he gets worse
(pause_short) be sure and let us know
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) well
but (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um

(pause_short) with the white
You got (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You rayed it with the cast on
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) and it was ready to come off
(pause_medium) She did a real good job of keeping it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) keeping it clean
and (pause_medium) dry
(pause_medium) That's
(pause_short) I think
(pause_medium) half the battle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) she didn't have any sores
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Kristen
(pause_medium) for the tranquilizer what do we
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) I wonder if she would need more

(pause_medium) Total
(pause_medium) thirteen extra
to put this (pause_short) cast on
(pause_short) Cause if you don't

(pause_medium) It's bad
(pause_medium) As we know from the sheep

(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) For the distemper vaccine
(pause_medium) No

(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Well
all we did (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I was in here and put a bandage on (Hx)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Six
(pause_short) one of these and one of these
(pause_medium) one of those

(pause_short) So
(pause_short) We'll se how (pause_medium)
to make sure he's (pause_medium) all right
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) XX
(pause_medium) XX there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
I was just trying to (vocal_noises_exhalation) figure out what we spent already
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) We've already spent fifty for him
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) two hundred or
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Any (pause_medium)
pretty much any time you can (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_medium) we could (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) still
it's more (pause_medium) expensive
(pause_medium) I think it'll do fine with a cast
(pause_medium) And it's not displaced
(pause_medium) should be pretty stable
(pause_medium) It'll be kind of a pain getting the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) well
(pause_short) maybe not
(pause_medium) Maybe not
(pause_medium) Well
as long as she's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) I'll give him a call
(pause_short) from home
(pause_short) In back in from the barn yet or not
(pause_medium) XXXXXXXX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_medium) called both the house number
(pause_medium) a little kid answered
(pause_medium) Yeah and they're little (pause_short) little kids too
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (COUGH)
(pause_medium) Yeah Carol
(pause_short) It's Marcia
(pause_medium) Hi
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) I was gonna let you know what
(pause_short) what was going on
(pause_medium) Should I talk to Richard
or (pause_short) you okay
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
It looks like (pause_short) she's got (pause_short) a spiral fracture
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Of (um)
(pause_short) (TSK) of her tibia
which is the bone between the knee (pause_medium) and the hock
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) um
It's f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) pretty stable
It's not displaced very far (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) anyway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it's
(um)
(pause_short) pretty much
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) she would do fine with a cast
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) with the
(pause_medium) oming in yesterday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) the bill was about fifty four
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) with the anasthesia
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) probably the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) It's gonna be about a hundred and fifty three
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) the only extra would be
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in about six (pause_short) to eight weeks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we would tranquilize her
and see if it's (pause_short) healed
(pause_short) Enough to take off
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's generally about thirty four to (pause_short) forty
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) You know
it would probably be even (pause_medium) a hundred more
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's
That's about the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) at this point the
(pause_medium) the least expensive alternative
(pause_short) for her
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) have him call me back
(pause_medium) if you
(pause_medium) (TSK) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And if she (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK)

(pause_short) Let's go and sit in the living room
We did this thing about (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) in science books and you see the solar system
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) How it's so (pause_short) out of scale
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_short) you cannot get a scale for d
(vocal_noises_laughter)

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But we're trying to do a scale for (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they had this thing (pause_short) drawn for a scale for (uh) distance
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) we started at one end of the hallway with a roll of toilet paper

(pause_medium) Distance like how wide it is
(pause_medium) like four and a half inch squares of toilet paper
down the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) in the hall
What hall (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Is that the junior high
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That we go by XX
(pause_short) But then
(pause_medium) (TSK) Starting from the sun
(pause_medium) Then we went about
(pause_medium) I think it was th maybe thirty seven
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then he says
(pause_medium) like this
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) not (pause_medium)
(pause_short) no bigger than that
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
we (pause_medium)
and we got out to (pause_medium) Earth
and I think it was a (vocal_noises_laughter) paperclip size
to punch through or something (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know just to kind of give us an idea of
(pause_short) How big was the sun
(pause_short) Did they say
(pause_medium) He had a softball sitting there
(pause_short) something like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When we got out to Jupiter

(pause_medium) a single
a large (pause_medium)
Uh the (pause_medium)

because otherwise (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Yeah
(uh)

(pause_medium) What was Pluto
Pluto must have been (pause_medium)
Well I have the i (pause_medium)

(pause_short) My butt fell asleep ear lier
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Never had that happen before
(pause_short) Anyway
(SNIFF) (pause_short) ts your butt (vocal_noises_laughter) falls asleep
(vocal_noises_exhalation) I have this whole paragraph written
XX (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
there's a POUND much POUND better way of (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) doing it structurally
Just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Because I put this big parenthesy here
(pause_short) create stress
(pause_short) Well what I might as well have done
(pause_short) I have
(pause_medium) and he got to hear READ
(pause_short) this and this and this
(pause_medium) And I interrupted with
(pause_short) READ he awakened at the silence READ
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) parenthesy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he got to hear READ
(pause_medium) It totally (pause_short) totally (pause_short) breaks (pause_medium) the paragraph
(pause_medium) And I should have just (pause_short) put this together
(pause_medium) the author does a great job
of describing (pause_medium) the silence
(pause_medium) And then did that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) But I don't have time to rewrite it
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) VOX No VOX
(pause_short) I wanna work on this (pause_medium)
Your (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you guys can overhear
There are (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) just
(pause_short) you go ahead
(pause_medium) What's that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) What is this
(pause_medium) Could try to draw Vodnoy from behind
get his (pause_medium) picture XX
(pause_medium) Yeah like
(pause_short) I don't know
off of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Thank goodness
(pause_medium) This is quite a picture Melissa had
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Ron
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) What
(pause_medium) Quite a photograph Melissa had here of Granddad
(pause_short) I thought it was pretty neat
That was even (pause_medium) more remarkable
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) We often meditate
(pause_medium) and those who have meditated on the love of Christ
(vocal_noises_inhalation) have imagined again and afresh
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) his (uh) bleeding wounds
(uh) see him as he died on the cross
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(pause_medium) wherever we turn
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) in (pause_short) considering the love of Christ
(pause_short) We turn to the real Jesus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) There (pause_short) there is where (pause_short) our (pause_short) meditation always centers
(vocal_noises_exhalation) That (pause_short) we might know him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh) see the wonder (vocal_noises_inhalation) of his love
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And not only hear him as he cries
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but (uh)
in his (pause_short) seeking love
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as the risen Lord
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh see him (uh)
(pause_medium) with that fish breakfast (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (SWALLOW) (pause_medium) Broiling fish
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Don't you like that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know he had that (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) he had that breakfast all cooking
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) While the disciples were still out in the boat
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium) And then (uh)
(pause_short) of course he has a special interview with Peter
(pause_medium) Not the first time he'd seen him
(uh) (pause_short) to Peter
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(pause_medium) And there are cocks crowing in the distance
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And Jesus says to Peter
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) do you love me
(pause_medium) (TSK) Simon
(pause_short) son of Jonah
(pause_short) do you love me
(pause_short) more than these
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Three times the question
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) as (uh) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) we were saying a bit ago (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) the love and the service go together
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) If Peter is to be restored in service
(pause_medium) he has to be restored in love
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And when (pause_short) Peter says
(uh)
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) feed my sheep
(pause_short) tend my lambs
(pause_short) care for my little ones
(pause_medium) We (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we can't love others
(pause_short) in the name of Christ
(pause_medium) unless (pause_short) the love for others is a (pause_short) overflow
(pause_short) of our love (pause_short) for the Lord himself
(pause_medium) The people that we're called to love
are (pause_short) unfortunately
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) not
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) warrantably lovable
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) We (uh)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) The source of our love
(pause_short) is (pause_short) not how appealing they are
(pause_medium) although
(pause_short) but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) nevertheless
(pause_medium) (uh) basically
the (pause_short) the fountain of our love
(vocal_noises_inhalation) i is (uh)
(pause_short) the seeking love of the savior
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The self denying love
(pause_medium) That is (uh) willing to serve (pause_short) in his name
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Do you love me
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) You know
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Jesus didn't ask Peter those questions
(pause_medium) to (pause_medium) undercut (pause_short) his (pause_short) love
(pause_medium) or his faith
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He asked those questions (pause_short) to establish it
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh) Jesus does the same with you
my friend (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) he does the same
(pause_medium) He does ask you
(pause_short) do you love me
(pause_short) Do you really love me
(pause_medium) But he asks it
(pause_short) in order that you'll be able to say at last with Peter
(pause_short) you know everything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) You know my heart
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And Lord you know that in spite of everything (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) yes (pause_short) Lord I do love you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_medium) the saving love of (uh) (pause_short) the Father
(vocal_noises_exhalation) and the Son
(pause_short) is also the saving love of the Spirit
(pause_short) and that's why I read that section from Romans eight
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh you see
God's (pause_short) love (pause_short) is (pause_short) is present (pause_short) in the Spirit
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) There there's a wonderful theology of the Spirit
in (uh)
(pause_short) in the Scriptures
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) (TSK)(vocal_noises_inhalation) Bultmann
in his (uh) commentary on (uh) Romans eight
(pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) talks about
(uh)
the two ways (pause_short) in which the Spirit (pause_short) i is spoken of
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
he talks about (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the the the Spirit in (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the sense of mana
(pause_short) as in (uh) (vocal_noises_inhalation) animism
(pause_short) you have a spirit of of a tree
or a (pause_short) a stone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then you have the more personal concept of the Spirit
(uh) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_short) I d I don't care for his analogy
but (uh) the point is well taken
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and as possessed
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You see
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) we are not demon possessed
(pause_short) we are Holy Spirit possessed
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Holy Spirit possession
(vocal_noises_inhalation) has a (pause_short) close relationship to demon possession
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You see
(uh) demon possession is always destructive
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because (uh) Satan can't create
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And the demon possessed man in Gadare
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) he couldn't even give his name
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh he (pause_medium)
You know how C S Lewis has done that in his (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) adult novels
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) but (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) S emon possession is personality destructive
because (uh) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Satan can only corrode
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) only
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The Holy Spirit
who brought (uh) order out POUND of chaos
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the Holy Spirit is the one who frees
(uh) liberates
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) the the the Gadarene demoniac thought he was free
(uh) absolute freedom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and he could treat people (pause_medium)
(pause_short) no dress code
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and so he stripped it all off
And the he (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he could (uh) d treat people any way he wanted to
(pause_short) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and (uh) then
and (uh) tore his own flesh apart
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) There's demonic liberty
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) (uh) now m
(pause_short) you'll accuse me of thinking (uh) of Holy Spirit liberty
(pause_short) because (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I remind you
Uh and (pause_medium) (THROAT)(SNIFF) (pause_medium) (THROAT) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And we'll pass over other (uh) (uh) Scriptural ac counts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) that's a little different
but (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (COUGH) (pause_short) (COUGH) (COUGh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you Presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh but
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And and the Holy Spirit
(uh) (uh) s the one
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) who has (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) ordered our lives
(pause_medium) If you love me
Uh I (pause_short) wanna say a little bit more about that in a moment
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The obedience of love
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But the Holy Spirit is the one who orders our lives
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) is in possession of our lives
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but the Holy Spirit's also given to us
he's not only (vocal_noises_inhalation) the possessor
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's also the one (pause_short) who is possessed
(pause_short) We possess him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He dwells in our hearts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but we have the gift of the Spirit
(pause_short) We have the Holy Spirit himself
(pause_short) The promise of the Father
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh they the disciples were to wait
(pause_short) until that great promise was given
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And so (pause_short) the Holy Spirit given to us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that (pause_medium) sense of the presence of God's love
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's why (uh) Paul says
(pause_short) that God (vocal_noises_inhalation) pours out his love in our hearts
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) By the Holy Spirit
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) there
(pause_short) does not describe (vocal_noises_inhalation) the love that we have for God
(pause_short) love joy peace (pause_short) so on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
Paul isn't talking about (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's talking about the gift of love that God has for us
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because he goes on to describe that love of God
(pause_short) God commends his love toward us
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So it's God's love for us
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Which is (uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) again
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) a wonderful (pause_short) reality
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because
(pause_short) if God didn't do that
(pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter) we wouldn't have a love for God (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) There's no (pause_short) spring of that divine love within us
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It comes from him
(pause_medium) And it does come from him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And so the Spirit is the spirit of (vocal_noises_exhalation) (uh) adoption
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh to make us POUND a ware POUND
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) we have to know
(pause_short) that he is our father
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it is the love of God
(pause_short) the knowledge that he does love us
(pause_short) that he is present with us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that (uh) (pause_short) becomes of course then the source
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of our (pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) love toward him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) friends
(uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) there's nothing more important
(pause_medium) For the whole balance
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Than
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) to realize
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the (uh)
(pause_short) the wonder
(pause_short) of our union with Jesus Christ
(pause_short) Through the Spirit
(pause_medium) Because it's in Jesus Christ that we are united to the Father
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and it is by the Spirit that Christ is present in our hearts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it's by the Spirit that the Father is present in our hearts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Two aspects (pause_short) of union with Christ
but it always pays to (pause_short) think about it again
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The representative union
(pause_short) the vital union
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The representative union
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The basis of our salvation
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When Christ died
(pause_medium) we died (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because he died for us
(pause_medium) He died as our representative
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) he died as (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) the one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) who bore our sins
(pause_short) In his own body
(vocal_noises_inhalation) on the tree
(pause_medium) So he was our representative
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he represented us
(pause_short) not only when he died for us
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then he ascended
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's why Paul says in Ephesians
(pause_short) Why
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Representatively
(pause_short) Where he is
(pause_short) we are
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_short) that's a tremendously
(pause_short) important of course
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's happened (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) See (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you are a a new creature in Christ
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You have triumphed over sin and death
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You have died to sin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And Paul's (pause_short) reasoning about how we ought to live
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Christ rose
(pause_short) that we are to seek the things which are above
(pause_short) (pause_short) You are risen with Christ
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because you died with Christ
therefore mortify (pause_short) sin in your members
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Put to death sin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In other words
(pause_short) Because of what Christ did for us
(pause_short) therefore
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) we live out of the fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of his perfect work
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And don't forget
(pause_short) Jesus not only paid the price of your sins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but remember that he lived a perfect life for you (hx)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That the white robe of righteousness
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's all that Christ MRC did for you MRC
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Jesus was baptized for you (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh let it be done to fill all righteousness
(pause_short) The righteousness he had to fill for you
(pause_short) See he he did it all for you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But then of course the other side of it is
(pause_short) Jesus Christ is the vine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and we are the branches
There is the (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) not only the (vocal_noises_inhalation) the the legal (uh) aspect of that which Christ did for us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there is the vital aspect
(pause_short) as he lives in us
and (vocal_noises_inhalation) and we walk with him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) every (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) y y you know
i (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) t's (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's been long fashionable in theological circles to (uh)
(pause_medium) sniff at the hymn
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) I walked in the garden alone
(uh) all this (uh) romantic business
and (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn
and yet everybody (pause_short) perversely seems to love it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh well (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I I I think
in spite of its (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) (uh) theological vacuity
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) is that it's (uh) experientially
(uh) retty much on target
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
We've all known those (uh) precious times of (uh) (vocal_noises_inhalation) of genuine fellowship with the Lord
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) that (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the knowledge that we have of him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is the knowledge of love
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) We just simply (pause_short) love him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) ow the mystics
l love to talk about (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we've got some kind of time constraint here
what (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (uh) (uh) what (pause_medium)
w (vocal_noises_inhalation) w w when do we
When (pause_medium)
so (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well
I I gotta be (pause_medium)
I I well (pause_medium)
Let me try to finish (vocal_noises_laughter) what I'm talking about here but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but (uh) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) SM there there (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to talk to types like you SM
(vocal_noises_laughter) you know it's wonderful (vocal_noises_laughter)
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(uh) it's particularly wonderful
(uh) but (throat) (pause_medium)
(LAUGHTER)
But (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) really
the the that (uh)
you know the Christian mystics (pause_short) talked about climbing Jacob's ladder
And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) you you you'd (pause_short) come up the ladder
(pause_short) at the very gate of heaven
(pause_short) And maybe (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe the gate will open
Y you can't (pause_short) control it
(pause_short) but maybe it will open
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And when it opens
(uh) it's (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) light (pause_short) bursting in your inner heart
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) once you've had that experience
you'd (pause_short) give anything to have the experience repeated
And so (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you go through any amount of discipline
and (uh)
and (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you recite the Jesus prayer thousands of times with the monks of Mount Athos
and (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(uh) you think it may happen
Uh the (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Well now (uh)
tha (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
I think Christians sometimes have (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) mingled that (uh) psychological experience
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) whether it's the left (pause_short) part or
(pause_short) or something
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't think (um)
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the (um)
(pause_short) the psychologists are as sure as they once were
(pause_short) but (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) at any rate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you see
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it isn't that we have to climb the ladder
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
I'm I'm sorry that that whole (vocal_noises_inhalation) episode with Jacob got misunderstood
(vocal_noises_inhalation) All because (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all because of the Hebrew preposition al
(pause_short) That (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh that see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
he he stood (pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) upon
(pause_medium) not it
(pause_medium) ee
he (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Jacob st saw the stairway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a tower of Babel type of thing
a (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a zigarot
(pause_short) r right
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) which was made for the gods to touch down at the top
and then they could come down (uh)
But but (uh)
and then (uh) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the god could be with the people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) but it it wasn't that that God (pause_medium)
that (pause_short) that (uh) Jacob saw God at the top of the ladder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) God stood (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) upon him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh the the masculine (uh) there
the (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) v v v vowel with the little dot (vocal_noises_laughter) over it
you know the (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the the holem
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh he he he's (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you know that's what it is
because the second time when God appeared to b h (uh) j Jacob at Bethel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) See
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(vocal_noises_laughter) That's what we miss (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He wasn't standing up there at the top
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) he came down the ladder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) when he came down the ladder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's why Jacob said
(pause_short) this is the gate of Heaven
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It was the House of God
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it it's
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So God was revealing himself to Jacob
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and God reveals himself to us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he seeks us
(pause_short) As we seek him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And our love is always in response to his love
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it's the assurance that your God loves you
(pause_short) that he seeks you
(pause_short) that he's with you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's this assurance
that draws you (vocal_noises_inhalation) to repentance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) h
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who quickens your love
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_medium) (TSK) I'm not going to say
(uh) (pause_short) th the rest of the things I (pause_short) I had in mind to say
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(uh) I
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you can fill out the talk for me
(pause_short) would you please sometime
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the (vocal_noises_inhalation) the commitment of love
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) remember
(uh) Mary's adoration
(pause_short) Uh when she (uh) (pause_short) brought the spikenard
and (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And Judas criticized her remember
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) Don't worship Jesus
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
but (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh y you see
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (uh)
What was the answer that Jesus (uh) gave
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) but in the sense of observing it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Observing a a an observance against his burial
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she realized who he was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He said the poor you have with you always
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you have not always
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A tremendous assurance of his own deity
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But Jesus said it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh) you see what that says to us
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) if our Lord were here
(pause_short) then we could pour out perfume on his feet
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He's not here
(pause_medium) But who is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The poor (pause_short) you have with you always (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So whose feet can we anoint
(vocal_noises_exhalation) The feet of the poor
(pause_short) in his name
(pause_medium) See
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) love (pause_short) (uh) (uh) doesn't mean
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) h climbing up (pause_short) Jacob's ladder (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) to the heavenlies
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) where nobody else can be around
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The love of God is experienced in the community of the saints
(pause_medium) it's experienced as we all reached out
(pause_short) reach out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the love of God is experienced
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in the course of service
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A I heard you describe some of these service projects
that (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um) (pause_short) Intervarsity is involved in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and friends
(um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) these (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) these projects
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) even if (uh) (pause_medium) they're working about rebuilding old houses
or whatever (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) they are not things that have nothing to do with love
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They are works of love
(pause_medium) They are (pause_short) the evidence
(pause_medium) of that (pause_short) love of God
(pause_short) in our hearts
(pause_short) that is borne
(vocal_noises_inhalation) by the tree
(pause_short) that has the roots down into the water of God's refreshing grace and love
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And (uh)
(pause_short) the mystical heights of Christian devotion
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) ought never to be separated (pause_short) from (pause_short) the realities
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of (uh) (pause_short) Christian (pause_short) service
(pause_medium) The (uh)
(pause_medium) there was a hymn (pause_short) in the old InterVarsity hymnal
a hymn that I (pause_short) love v very much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Talks about how we go with Jesus through the desert
and through (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the sufferings
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And (uh)
(pause_short) its very last verse is (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ he who in his hour of sorrow
(pause_short) bore the curse alone
trod (pause_short) where he had gone
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He and I
(pause_short) in that (pause_short) bright glory
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) one deep joy (pause_short) shall (pause_short) share
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Mine
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) to be (pause_short) forever with him
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) His
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) that (pause_short) I am there READ (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) My friends
(pause_medium) in the wonder of God's love
(pause_medium) He's pleased with you
(pause_medium) God who looked at his own Son
(pause_short) and his heart rejoiced
(pause_medium) His heart rejoices this morning
(pause_short) In your praise
(pause_medium) In your worship
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In the service of your hands
(pause_medium) In the love of your heart
(pause_medium) Shall we pray
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Our heavenly Father
(pause_medium) we (pause_medium) annot find words to express our love for you
(pause_medium) because we are overwhelmed by your love for us
(pause_medium) Lord Jesus
(pause_medium) how may we speak to you

(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)

And it was this (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) VOX incredible closet VOX
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Every night before I (pause_short) went to bed
(pause_medium) that closet door
(pause_medium) was closed
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I knew
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I wasn't gonna sleep
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was afraid of that boogy man
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) You know

(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was scared of that VOX
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Were you afraid of him Paul
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Were you afraid of that closet
(pause_medium)
(LAUGHTER_CHEERS_APPLAUSE)
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) You know
(uh)
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Some of us didn't get along
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it was always interesting
that (pause_short) when you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) got into trouble
(pause_short) you ended up (pause_short) dealing with a number of (pause_short) kids
(pause_short) besides just one
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So I know of several times
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) After school
(pause_short) (COUGH)
(pause_short) Cause I went to a different school than they went to
(pause_short) Uh oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So it's kinda like
VOX (uh) oh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they can't come in the schoolyard
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause the adults'll put em out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But they're out there waiting
(pause_short) we're gonna get you
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We're after you VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and what I would do is
(pause_short) go all the way around
(pause_medium) VOX Jumping fences
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) ducking down behind cars VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so those guys couldn't get me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) cause I was afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Those guys were gonna beat the tar out of me
(pause_medium) Smart (pause_medium)
and (pause_short) things like that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) eventually
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I couldn't run
(pause_medium) eventually I had to deal with my fear
(pause_short) and confront
(pause_medium) Yep
(pause_medium) I still did get the (pause_medium) daylights beat out of me
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I confronted my fear
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know I wanna talk a little bit about fear today
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) cause I believe it's something that keeps us
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) from doing everything we can do
as (pause_short) human beings
(pause_medium) the potential that God has given us
(pause_medium) and I believe it also
(pause_medium) really keeps us from
(pause_medium) a
(pause_medium) strong spiritual (pause_short) walk with God
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's open to Mark chapter (uh)
(pause_medium) five
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) verse thirty five

(vocal_noises_inhalation) they took him along
(pause_short) just as he was
(pause_medium) In the boat
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) There were also other boats with him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A furious squall came up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so that it was nearly swamped
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Jesus was in the stern
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Sleeping on a cushion READ
(pause_medium) VOX Hey
(pause_short) Man VOX
(pause_medium) READ The disciples woke him and said to him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q teacher
(pause_medium) Don't you care if we drown Q
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He got up
(pause_medium) rebuked the wind
(pause_medium) and said to the waves
(pause_medium) Quiet
(pause_medium) Be still
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then the wind died down
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He said to his disciples
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Why are you so afraid
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Do you still have no faith
(pause_short) (COUGH)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They were terrified
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and asked each other
(pause_medium) Q Who is this Q
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Even the wind and the waves
(pause_medium) obey him READ
(pause_medium) Let's go on
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well READ they went across the lake to the region (vocal_noises_inhalation) of Geras (pause_medium)
(uh) (pause_short) Gerasenes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) when Jesus got out of the boat
(pause_short) came from the tombs to meet him READ
(pause_medium) I don't think he walked up and shook his hand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ This man lived in the tombs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) not even with a chain
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) For he had often been chained
(vocal_noises_inhalation) hand and foot
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But he tore the chains apart
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No one was strong enough to subdue him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Night and day among the tombs and in the hills
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he would cry out and cut himself
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with stones
(pause_medium) When he saw Jesus from a distance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He ran and fell on his knees in front of him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He shouted at the top of his voice
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) F What do you want with me Jesus F
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Son of the Most High God
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) F Swear to God that you won't torture me F
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) for Jesus had said to him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q Come out of this man
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you evil spirit Q
(pause_medium) Then Jesus asked him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What is your name
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Q My name is legion Q
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he replied
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q for we are many Q
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he begged Jesus again and again
(vocal_noises_inhalation) not to send them out into the area
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The demons begged Jesus
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Q send us among the pigs
(pause_medium) He gave them permission
(vocal_noises_inhalation) came out and went into the pigs
aa (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The herd about two thousand in number
(vocal_noises_inhalation) rushed down the steep bank into the lake
(pause_short) and were drowned
(pause_medium) Those tending the pigs ran off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and reported this in the town
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and countryside
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And the people went out to see what had happened
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When they came to Jesus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Sitting there
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) dressed in his right mind
(pause_medium) And they were afraid
(pause_medium) (TSK) Those who had seen it told the people what had happened
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) T what had happened to the demon possessed man
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he told about the pigs
(pause_medium) as well
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then the people MRC began to plead with Jesus MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to leave their region READ
(pause_medium) P and I'm gonna stop right there P
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the disciples (vocal_noises_inhalation) were afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They were terrified
(pause_medium) Of what had happened in the boat
(pause_medium) You know what it's like to be terrified
(pause_medium) Have you ever been terri fied
(pause_short) I mean that's a pretty scary thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) especially if you've experienced it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe you were in a car wreck one time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we were going sixty miles an hour
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and we're going down the freeway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) trailor truck hits his brakes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he s (pause_medium)
he's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I thought he's coming through us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) another person smashes us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) glass is flying everywhere
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I'm saying Lord take me quickly
(pause_medium) I was scared to death
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We ended up in the middle of the median
(pause_medium) h
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I had to crawl out through a window
(pause_medium) I was terrified
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I know that feeling
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's (pause_short) what the disciples were feeling at that time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they were terrified
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They didn't understand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What was going on
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then we see the demon possessed man
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) really
(pause_medium) think about (pause_short) how possessed he really was
He was strong enough (vocal_noises_inhalation) to break irons
(pause_short) Yep
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that were on his feet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he cried out in the evening
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and cut himself (vocal_noises_inhalation) with stones
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean he was a pretty wild guy
(MURMUR)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He gave him back (pause_medium) his sanity
(pause_short) He gave him back (pause_medium) his mind
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And the people (pause_short) came out to see what had happened
(vocal_noises_inhalation) cause they heard about the pigs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they came out it says
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they were afraid too
(pause_medium) They were afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Just like the disciples were afraid
(pause_medium) They were afraid
(pause_medium) and they asked Jesus
(pause_medium) to leave
(pause_medium) the region
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know it's amazing but
(pause_medium) (TSK) that fear
(pause_medium) because they didn't understand
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And they wanted to control
(pause_medium) the situation
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know fear is o (pause_medium) crippling
(pause_medium) XX
(pause_short) I mean it just knocks on our door
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Every single day we get up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it knocks on our door
(pause_medium) Amen
(pause_short) We all have different fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it kind of (vocal_noises_inhalation) pulls us in
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It keeps us (vocal_noises_inhalation) from moving
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We become immobile
(pause_medium) And that truly is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what was happening
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to the people
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Their response was
Q no thi (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) this is incredible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This is the son of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Look at the great miracle that he's performed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's given this man peace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's given this man sanity
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's given this man life again
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we're grateful to you Jesus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We're happy Jesus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We're excited about what you're doing here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) SHOUT please stay with us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) forever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we'll feed you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We'll become your friends
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We'll pray with you we'll learn from you SHOUT Q
(pause_medium) (BUZZ)
(pause_medium) wrong
(pause_medium) Q Jesus
(pause_medium) you just need to leave our region Q
(pause_medium) Cause they were afraid
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Because they MRC didn't understand MRC
(pause_medium) And they were no longer in control
(pause_medium) But Jesus
(pause_medium) was in control
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) They realized
(pause_medium) no other man
(pause_medium) could possibly do
(pause_medium) That there was something different (pause_medium) about Jesus
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But their fear (pause_medium) kept them (pause_medium) from finding out (pause_medium) exactly (pause_medium) who Jesus was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Does your fear keep you (pause_medium) from knowing (vocal_noises_inhalation) exactly (pause_medium) who Jesus (pause_medium) is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Does your fear keep you from a radical (vocal_noises_inhalation) relationship (pause_medium) with God
(pause_short) (SNIFF) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Does it keep you (vocal_noises_inhalation) from a personal (vocal_noises_inhalation) relationship (pause_short) with God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) More than just going to church on Sunday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) going to a mid week service
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or
(vocal_noises_inhalation) even going to Bible talks
(pause_medium) Or group discussions
(pause_medium) Or one on one study
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Does your fear keep you from that radical (vocal_noises_inhalation) personal (vocal_noises_inhalation) relationship with God
(pause_short) XX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) deep personal relationships (pause_medium) with one another
(pause_medium) You know the world is an interesting place
(pause_medium) We all (pause_medium) crave that
(pause_short) Don't we
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we're looking for friendship

PAR (pause_medium) I always get those two mixed up
(pause_medium) You look so much arike like yeah PAR
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when we were in the middle of the snow storm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he decided
and the g and and the and the brothers in (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that apartment
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So he went around the building
which f (pause_short) in itself is crazy
(pause_short) (MURMUR_LAUGHTER_THROAT)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) How many times have you done that in your life
(pause_medium) m_it's crazy
(pause_medium) It's out of the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Maybe a little bit insane
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) knocking on doors
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he said it was amazing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I could hear people there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but they wouldn't come to the door
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then there were others he knocked on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but they wouldn't open the door
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then there were others
(pause_medium) (COUGH)
VOX Just t (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) to see who was there

(LAUGHTER)
(pause_short) who opened their door
(pause_medium) and went to the service
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and it changed their lives
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But fear
(vocal_noises_inhalation) keeps us from those personal relationships
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with one another
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) We're so concerned about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what everybody else thinks
(pause_medium) What's someone gonna think
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) What is someone gonna think
(pause_medium) That I don't do these things anymore
(pause_medium) Jeez
(pause_medium) to learn about Jesus
(pause_medium) And to study the Bible
(pause_medium) See we're so concerned
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that fear robs us
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) of that deep (pause_short) personal relationship with God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that deep personal relationship (pause_short) with one another
(pause_medium) We all experience it
(pause_medium) It keeps us
(pause_medium) fear keeps us (pause_short) from changing our lives
(pause_short) (MURMUR)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Fear (pause_short) keeps us (pause_medium) from changing (pause_medium) the world
(pause_medium) needed to overcome their fears
(pause_medium) In order that they might have that radical relationship with God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) The disciples needed to overcome their fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in order to have a deep personal relationship with one another
(pause_medium)(vocal_noises_inhalation) The disciples
(vocal_noises_inhalation) needed to overcome
(pause_short) their fears
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in order to
(pause_short) change their lives
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The disciples
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in order to change the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And if we go back and we examine the Gospels
(vocal_noises_inhalation) very clearly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that all the time that Jesus spent with them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they were afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Peter was afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Thomas was afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They were many many times afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But they (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they understood
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the only way they would overcome their fear
(pause_short) would be
(vocal_noises_inhalation) through Jesus Christ
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because the Lord had many challenging times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in his life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Where fair (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Where fear
(pause_medium) could be the dominant factor
(pause_medium) That could take away
(vocal_noises_inhalation) his relationship
(pause_medium) with God
(pause_medium) Amen
(pause_medium) You know I was (uh)
(pause_medium) thinking about fear
(pause_medium) And I guess that
(pause_medium) (COUGH)
(pause_medium) two or three hundred people
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (MURMUR)
(pause_medium) But I really wanna overcome my fears
(MURMUR_AGREEMENT)
(pause_medium) deeper and deeper with the Lord
(pause_medium) I wanna get deeper and deeper with you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanna get d (pause_medium)

(pause_short) (MURMUR_AGREEMENT)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) outside of the Bible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) Cause the guy blows my mind
(pause_medium) He blows my (pause_medium)
(pause_short) for what he believed
(pause_medium) He died (pause_medium) to see (pause_medium) justice
(pause_medium) equality
(pause_medium) peace
(pause_medium) He died for that
(pause_medium) And I'm thinking
(pause_medium) He is willing to MRC drink that cup MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He was afraid many times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but he pushed through his fears
(pause_medium) In order (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) to (pause_medium) succeed and have victory
(pause_medium) For himself
(pause_medium) and for the people
(pause_medium) that were around him
(pause_medium) The Black nation of America
(pause_medium) You know we need to learn
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The first point is to face (pause_medium) our fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In order to overcome our fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we must face (vocal_noises_inhalation) our fears
(pause_short) Amen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to spend a lot of time with my brother
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and just to talk
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And and as we were talking
(vocal_noises_inhalation) his fears
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What he was (pause_short) afraid of
(pause_medium) In becoming (pause_medium) a disciple
(pause_medium) In becoming (vocal_noises_inhalation) a Christian
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it brought me back
(pause_short) to the time when I was studying the Bible
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I remember all of the fears that were in my life
(pause_medium) in c in in (pause_short) making a decision
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to follow Christ
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know I can remember the fear of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they all wanna take my money
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) I worked hard for my money
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was concerned about this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC POUND cultic organization MRC
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) My wife would write a check for ten dollars
(pause_short) They would take my money
(pause_medium) Right Paul
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) as you can see
(LAUGHTER)
(MURMUR)
(pause_medium) Well as you can see
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Still got one (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Maybe it needs to change some
(pause_medium) I was afraid that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) F I'd be robbed of my individuality
(pause_medium) I'd be robbed of my independence and my free will F
(pause_medium) Well let me tell you
(pause_medium) I'm plenty independent
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) And I have f a free will to choose and pick
(pause_medium) what I want to do with my life
(pause_medium) is to overcome my fears
(pause_medium) and give my life
(pause_medium) to Jesus Christ
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But we must face our fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ask yourselves
(pause_medium) why are you afraid
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Think about your own fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Think about your own personal fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) inside your life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The deep ones
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But the deep deep truths in your heart
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause each one of us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that we're very fearful about
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Ask yourself
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Why (pause_short) am I afraid
(pause_medium) (COUGH)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We need to ask ourselves that question
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it comes up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because in that way
(pause_short) confronting our fears
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It will give us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a measure of success
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It doesn't mean we've done it yet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but when we bring it up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It will give us a measure of success
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Not the total victory
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but a small measure to understand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) where we're really at
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) the thing about fears
(pause_medium) The more we attempt to ignore or repress them
(pause_medium) the more (pause_medium) we multiply (pause_medium) the conflict inside
(pause_medium) You know when you're afraid to deal with something
(pause_medium) and then all of a sudden
(BBBB)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And the longer that fear goes
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the more it multiplies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) till it gets to the point where it (pause_short) totally immobilizes you
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Till you become
(vocal_noises_inhalation) totally
(vocal_noises_inhalation) unable to move
(pause_medium) You become stymied
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) Still
(pause_medium) And we know as human beings
(pause_short) just like nature
(pause_medium) if we're not growing
(pause_medium) we're dying
(pause_short) starts to eat (pause_short) away (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) at you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know the great thing about bringing your fears up too
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Is that when you bring your fears up
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) what we find out many times
(pause_medium) is that they're more imaginary
(pause_medium) than they are real
(pause_medium) I need to talk to Windham
(pause_medium) about this
(pause_medium) It's like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then I start
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (BBBB)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) Then (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's gonna say that and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's gonna be in my face and
(pause_medium) And I'm like
(pause_medium) and then I go and I talk to him
I muster up (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) PAR which is m our second point
(pause_medium) That isn't anything like I thought
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) VOX What a fool VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) that I would think those things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) See because a lot of times our fears
(pause_medium) really are
(pause_medium) imaginary
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See
(vocal_noises_inhalation) fear
really involves the misuse (pause_medium) of our imagination
(pause_medium) Yeah that's right
(pause_medium) You know when you're talking about being a disciple
and you hear these incredibly (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX hard sermons VOX
(pause_medium) And I do preach a few hard sermons
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) I thought I'd give you a break
(LAUGHTER)
Maybe I needed a break (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But really
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we we and you hear these A incredibly hard sermons A
(vocal_noises_inhalation) F A VOX well what do they mean about this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and what do they mean about that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh ho (vocal_noises_inhalation) ha oh ha VOX A F
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I'd be like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) F VOX Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Who is this man
(pause_medium) Oh I can't believe he said that VOX F
(LAUGHTER)
I'd be sharing (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Boy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I hope he doesn't preach that and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I hope he doesn't say this and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I hope he doesn't say that VOX
(MURMUR_AGREEMENT)
See and we (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (BBBB)
(pause_short) (LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) our imagination runs wild
(pause_medium) P See (um)
the misuse (pause_short) of our imagination
(pause_medium) as opposed to the positive
(pause_medium) You could use that imagination
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) in a great positive way
(pause_medium) to give you courage P
(pause_medium) And that's really my second point
(pause_short) we really need to
(pause_medium) be able to
(pause_medium) (TSK) have courage
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Look it at (pause_medium) first John chapter four
(pause_medium) Actually
(pause_medium) this point within the point
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You know it's
(pause_short) it was really pretty straightforward this morning
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
(pause_medium) y z (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I thought you did a good job all the way through
(pause_medium) I mean you were on top of what you were scanning
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_short) should've kept that one Horizon
(pause_medium) Why did you switch em
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) looking at something
I would get (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) part of it to provide a good service
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Well
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) that that (pause_medium)
I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) well
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I mean when we're on ten
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so you really want your arrivals on the right
(pause_short) When you're landing two eight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) then you can (pause_short) get departures off of
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) but (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) sure doesn't hurt them to taxi any
(pause_medium) A number one service
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
every one of em came (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they're right by the gate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Everyone (pause_medium)
(pause_short) even one or (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they said w
and they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we'd like the left
if it (vocal_noises_laughter) becomes available (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) There's sh (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) Traffic Watch Eight we discussed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) So radar service ter minated
(um)
(pause_medium) or
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You wanna say Q radar service terminated
(pause_short) Report back inbound Q
(pause_medium) Or
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I I think that something a little ttle (pause_short) more like that's better
he's kinda (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Left hanging
(pause_short) And you could just say
(pause_medium) radar service terminated
and then he'll (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) he'll either come back and say
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Or I'll call you back inbound
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) But (uh)
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Along with that
(pause_medium) Let TC
(pause_short) do more of the work for you
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) just tell her what you want her to do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I was thinking of a (pause_short) couple (pause_medium) instances
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was thinking that for my rundowns
(pause_medium) you know that would (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) that's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that would have been a help
(vocal_noises_inhalation) on the other s the other hand
(pause_medium) I wanna get it on tape
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Did you hear that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(um)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The problem with doing rundowns
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) pretty far over to the left there
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I'm (pause_short) just (pause_short) working at
(pause_medium) doing as much (pause_short) of these other things as I possibly can
(pause_medium) Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC
and just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) just (pause_medium) challenging myself
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
other than (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that I should have used her for that I didn't
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Depending on who your (pause_medium)
they d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And sometimes that is p (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If you just
(pause_short) if you just
(pause_short) all you have to do is stand up
(pause_medium) and look out the window
(pause_short) and talk
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You no other w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or ARTS functions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That really is nice
(pause_medium) It it really helps
(pause_medium) the situation
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) but
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Right now
(pause_short) (TSK) (um)
(pause_medium) I don't think there was (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) just a couple that I switched to the left
(uh) p (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (uh) probably two or three
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and so there was that
I didn't have any (pause_medium) ARTS entries
(pause_medium) you know
(um)
(YAWN) (pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) I mean I was able to k (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) there wasn't really nothing much to do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) But there could be
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Yeah
I told her (pause_short) to do my (pause_medium) VFR guys
(pause_short) h Yeah
And (um)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Now are we still required to w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Don't they
(pause_short) We are
(pause_medium) Any VFR
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now isn't that
(pause_medium) aren't they when they c (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But what if they've (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) c well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR
(pause_medium) Well yeah
(pause_medium) I don't (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) actually
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I'm like you
(pause_medium) Because we do have a record of em anyway
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) when the (pause_medium)
when the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) order came across or whatever
(pause_medium) (TSK) Okay
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) P I'll do that then P
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When Horizon one thirty eight didn't answer you there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Go back to ground
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) I mean you tried him a couple times
(pause_medium) if they don't get the hint
if he's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but if you can't get him
(pause_medium) just go on
(pause_short) United was calling ready to go
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) just let United go
(pause_medium) Hori zon
(pause_medium) So just go on to the next
(pause_medium) Next thing
(pause_medium) He might be still on ground frequency
which is (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) usually not too likely
(pause_medium) you know
He's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) from the tower you know
(pause_medium) looking at his radio about then
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
cause I wanted to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) to get him out at that point
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) I should've been more flexible and
(pause_medium) But (uh)
(pause_short) everything else I saw
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you your separation was
(pause_short) was really good this morning
(pause_short) Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight
(vocal_noises_laughter) a little to tight (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (SNORT) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Cause (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it worked out great
(pause_medium) One guy out the right and then (pause_medium)
oh th (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And it worked out good
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I think it worked out because
(pause_medium) (TSK) this guy
on (pause_short) on (pause_short) starting his departure roll
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) before you clear the next guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And watch out for the (uh)
(pause_short) the seven thirty seven
(pause_medium) four hundreds
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Because (uh) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) they'll really climb
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) well you know
(pause_medium) But (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Good departure separation
(pause_medium) Thanks
(pause_short) I was impressed
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) Heading
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Listen to the readbacks for (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) If I know he's at two thirty
(pause_medium) But you can wrap em around
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There was that one time you had (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) two south plan aircraft
and one (pause_medium) westbound (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) I d (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you were gonna have three miles between the two first
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) That was perfect
(pause_medium) The one that I kept on runway heading for a bit
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) And that was good
(pause_short) it was real good planning
(pause_medium) To ensure that you had
(pause_medium) oh and you had the one going two forty
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) or some thing
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
and then you had the Metro going s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) going two sixty
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Which is really good planning
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) less and less (pause_medium) impacted
(pause_short) For lack of a better word
(pause_medium) by
(pause_medium) these g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) I think
(pause_medium) the bulk of (pause_short) my planning
(pause_medium) seems to revolve around these little guys
(pause_short) when I can turn em
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that is
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) those guys
(pause_medium) having a very fec affective part
(pause_short) in the whole fan
(pause_short) of all our departures
(pause_medium) And (um)
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_short) I think they're
(pause_medium) they're a (pause_short) affecting me less than they did in the past
(pause_short) Yeah
(H) (vocal_noises_laughter) Do you know what I mean (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) cause i (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I mean that sequence was good too
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but there was a time when
(pause_medium) yeah an (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
Who knows (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the little West Coasts in here
(pause_medium) where am I actually gonna fit these guys in
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) Well the sequence
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) When you got (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) XX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and from bravo
(pause_medium) You know (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) All he did is send em all out
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) you can pick and choose
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when they get there
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) You know th
(pause_medium) That way
(pause_medium) They're b (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) e (pause_medium)
(pause_short) essentially on their own (pause_medium) taxiway
up through (pause_medium)
up to the (pause_short) approach end
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) (YAWN) So that was about all
(pause_medium) that I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
and I didn't (pause_short) really see much of a problem
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) XX
(pause_medium) to talk about
(pause_medium) I'm glad
(pause_medium) S (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh (um)
(pause_short) don't always
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) don't insist on always saying
(pause_medium) seven hundred
If you say (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
Why hadn't you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) when you did
It was out in the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Well I mean y w (pause_medium)
it was at (pause_medium)
he was a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) just go ahead and say
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for a little bit
(pause_medium) but that's no big deal
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) It seemed like you were a little tense with that but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in
(pause_medium) Did you see that
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) So that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that worked out great
I wondered if you'd saw (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Lots of time
(pause_short) For some reason
he just used the (pause_medium)
Or is it (uh)
(pause_medium) One of those guys is usually really fast
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Jet Speed is th I know fast on the pr departure
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I think
(pause_short) It (pause_short) seems like that was the one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) And he was actually floating at (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the Jet Speed wasn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) yeah
(pause_medium) When the Twins (pause_medium) get airborne
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) If you got six thousand feet
(pause_medium) you can start your transmission
(pause_short) to the jet
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) momentarily
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Just didn't wanna be sure he gets his turn in
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) if you wanna get (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah what do you say
and I af (pause_short) feel like I was stumbling over that
(pause_short) couple different ways
(pause_medium) A mile west
or something (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know on a day like this
(pause_medium) is southwestbound
(pause_short) Q Runway two eight left
(pause_medium) And and they'll
(pause_short) a lot of times they'll say (uh) in sight
(pause_medium) If they don't say in sight
(pause_medium) they'll say
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) they'll (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) but it's safe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because
(pause_medium) ne thing
(vocal_noises_exhalation) you could do
is is turn the (pause_short) Caravan to two forty
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) just before you ship em
(pause_medium) Hm
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Cause the track's what im (pause_short) what's important
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) but two fifty was working out fine today
(pause_medium) Fifteen degrees and a mile
(pause_medium) Is what you need so
(pause_medium) or less
(pause_short) using visual
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Was the West Coast that
(pause_medium) was it the Horizon who said he could (pause_short) do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead
(pause_short) ((PHONE_RING))
(pause_short) don't need it now
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) They got it
(pause_medium) Somebody in there
(pause_medium) Comm
(pause_medium) line for you
(pause_short) This is Randy
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) M_bye
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) was the
this (uh)
(pause_medium) This was the be gin ning of the (uh) change
(uh) trains
and (uh)
(pause_medium) car riages
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think Margaret though
I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't think we can underestimate her (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) that I have known
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Henry Wilcox may think he's in control
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And there would never be a Jacky Bast
(pause_medium) While she (pause_medium) is (pause_medium) (uh) the head of (pause_short) of that h (pause_short) household
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Whereas I thought Missis Wilc (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Was so other worldly
(pause_short) as to what was going on
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So I felt that
(pause_medium) that (uh) Margaret is
(pause_medium) is
(pause_short) and I thought for this time
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) just in charge
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the to b (pause_medium)
to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
So she (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you don't have to make a big to do about it
but she also (pause_medium)
(pause_short) A lot of charisma
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And very positive
(H) (pause_medium) but she just radiated something which was (pause_short) personality
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
a funny (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) one of them
(pause_short) (uh) was my niece
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think I used the word heroine
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And she said Q heroine Q
(pause_medium) And she couldn't see Margaret as a heroine
I think Margaret (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe she was too strong
(pause_medium) Uh
we're used to seeing someone as the (uh)
(pause_medium) as a romantic
as (uh) all of that
(pause_medium) And I (pause_medium)
You (pause_medium)
(pause_short) no
t (pause_medium)
Just the (pause_medium)
because (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
And an (pause_medium)
be (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Because
the other thing about Margaret that would be (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) a heroine
(pause_short) she (pause_short) sticks with Henry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that
(pause_short) They would have thought that
(pause_short) marching out and saying VOX I won't stay VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX I won't marry you VOX or
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (THROAT) excuse me
I wanted to know what (pause_medium) you thought about
(pause_medium) why she agreed to marry him (pause_medium) to begin with
(pause_short) Because although I understand (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the reasons that are given in the book
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I still (pause_short) couldn't quite (pause_medium) decide that
(pause_short) that's something she would have decided to do
(pause_medium) Uh but I n (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Her chances were
it was (pause_short) changing
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) Ha (pause_medium)
according to the b (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (uh)
a lot of critics felt (pause_medium) that he was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I think (pause_short) maybe (pause_short) Forster wanted him to be that way
and I just didn't (pause_medium) look at it that way
But I thought he had a lot of good (pause_short) qualities
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (H)
(pause_medium) This is for the movie
(pause_medium) Uhuh
I mean he (pause_medium)
and I (pause_medium)
he r (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) he (uh)
(pause_medium) she described him as (pause_medium) a charming
(pause_medium) mhm
(pause_medium) when she was talking about him to somebody
(pause_short) Helen or th
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Margaret said
(pause_medium) you know he
(pause_medium) I mean Mister Wilcox is a charming (pause_medium) man
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) and I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I guess that's what kept (vocal_noises_inhalation) kinda s bringing me up short on
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) believing this marriage
(pause_medium) after all (pause_medium)
(pause_short) there wasn't a (pause_short) great deal of opportunity
for a (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I was gonna say
(pause_medium) I don't know
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
but she (pause_medium)
well the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) and then the rest of em (pause_medium)
and yen (pause_medium)
Well the her (pause_medium)
but Henry was a gainst (pause_medium)
But the (pause_medium)
but the (pause_medium)
Yeah but that was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_medium) perhaps I misunderstood that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
I (pause_medium)
I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I agree more with Linda
that (pause_medium)
that I think it was a situa tion where Paul (vocal_noises_inhalation) couldn't marry anybody
because he had to go (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) overseas
and make his f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) and maybe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) those families see
(pause_medium) who would get married
(pause_medium) whether they could support somebody or not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) they strongly felt that you had to have a certain amount of money
(pause_short) or a certain future in order to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) end up (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Why couldn't Helen have just supported them
that wasn't (pause_medium)
they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they wouldn't have allowed that
That's not a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That wouldn't have been alright
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
the the the (pause_medium)
the (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) strong English honor
that they (uh)
(pause_medium) that Charles had to de fend
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
when (uh) Margaret (uh)
(pause_medium) when Margaret married (uh) Mister Wilcox
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What (pause_medium)
(uh) did (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Where did they live
JANICE (pause_medium) I think they lived in the big house
(pause_medium) They were (pause_medium) in Howard's End
(pause_short) I thought it was Helen and the little boy
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) all of em were at Howard's End
I thought all of em (pause_medium)
XXXX (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Henry
(pause_medium) Helen
they were all one big happy family (vocal_noises_laughter)
W (pause_short) when uh (pause_medium)
wasn't it (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
and the other thing (pause_medium)
and when (uh) (pause_short) they married
did (uh)
(pause_short) (uh) what was his name
the (uh) (pause_short) wimpy little son
(pause_medium) Tibby
the bro (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and the young girl come and live with them
(pause_medium) I don't know what happened to Tibby
Tibby was (pause_medium)
Well (pause_medium)
When (pause_short) when he they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) conceived
(pause_medium) Ger many
un til (pause_medium)
friend of t (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That was be fore they got married
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_medium) Maybe they didn't live there the whole time
(pause_short) and she's away some where
be cause she is n't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) She's hiding
Isn't it (pause_short) also basically (pause_short) a woman's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the women are much more developed characters than the men
(pause_short) And the men tend to be
(pause_medium) I think so
(pause_short) an (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Ex cept he was raised by his mother
(pause_short) but
(pause_short) aunt and so on
(pause_medium) Yeah
so the (pause_short) the mo (pause_medium)
the mothers have always been (uh)
(pause_medium) women (pause_short) figures in his life were so strong obviously
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) Bu (pause_short) but (pause_short) but the fellow
is (pause_medium)
phy sically (pause_short) weak
(uh) person
(pause_medium) Uh
(vocal_noises_laughter) they all had asthma (vocal_noises_laughter)
I wouldn't know who (pause_medium)
they always (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Hm
and (uh)
and Paul wasn't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they all had uh
PATTY (pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Diane (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you're talking about the woman having the money
(pause_medium) Mhm
marry the (pause_medium)
in (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) Out of Africa
(pause_medium) Or may well maybe it's s second world war
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But Isak Dine sen
the (pause_medium) heroine of out of Africa is Danish
and she ends up (pause_medium)
a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the brother of the person that she's in love with marries her
so they agree (pause_medium) to get married
because he will then (pause_short) have access to her money and title
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So it was done
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that a woman of means
(pause_medium) as (uh)
(pause_medium) an arrangement for what (pause_medium) ever reason
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah I (pause_medium)
and so it (pause_short) could have been that this
(pause_short) I guess (pause_medium)
That's to me (uh) (uh)
(pause_short) kind of a m (pause_medium)
(pause_short) not taken care of
(pause_short) very well in the book
(pause_short) I I guess I don't (pause_medium) know why they didn't (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I have a question about England in nineteen ten
(pause_medium) Which shows that my (pause_medium) lack of history
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Was England the strong world power in nineteen ten
(pause_short) still
The w (pause_medium) empire
Tha that was where (uh)
In s (pause_medium)
Some kind of trade in (uh)
(pause_medium) I g I've forgotten what it was
(pause_medium) Uh was it (pause_medium)
I think he had rubber tr (pause_short) plantations
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) a hundred years ago in college
(pause_short) and that was all about (pause_medium) the colony of India
(pause_short) Mhm
and (pause_short) Eng lish colonial things
So I thought England was in a (pause_short) position of great strength
(pause_short) in nineteen ten
(pause_short) I think it was
(pause_medium) move away
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) had begun to blow
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
When (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Well that's what I'm trying to think of
(pause_short) well close to that
w (pause_medium)
(uh)
they (uh)
The (uh)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) what was it
(uh) the
(pause_medium) her son came in
(pause_medium) Was that Edward
The one that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
the ward in (pause_short) a (pause_short) England
(pause_short) such a
(pause_short) Well he was weak
(pause_short) Wasn't he
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) That was later
(pause_medium) That was later
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Well at the beginning of World War (pause_medium) One
(pause_medium) in The Guns of August
(pause_short) They
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
all of the (pause_short) crowned heads
(pause_short) was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that was the last time they were all together
So it had already (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was
(pause_medium) well over the horizon into setting
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
So nineteen ten it just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
the winds (pause_short) of change (pause_short) beginning to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) did she
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's when they div divest ed
Well maybe (pause_medium)
(pause_short) was af ter r Second World War
(pause_medium) May be the power over them was becoming weak
XXX (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) wasn't that part of the problem they had
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) hold the colonies together
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I thought so
That they had to be (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_short) But I think that was part of the problem
because they couldn't be (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Deb orah
I think (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) more was World War Two
(pause_short) Uh
(pause_medium) more like World War Two
(pause_short) M hm
when Gandhi (pause_medium)
(pause_short) So the thir ties and forties maybe
was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It was kind of interesting to read these (uh)
(pause_medium) critical (pause_short) reviews
I got this out of the book (pause_medium) review digest
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Reviews (vocal_noises_laughter) were writ ten in nineteen ten (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Here's one (pause_medium)
(pause_short) When was the book written
(pause_short) Nine teen ten
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_short) Published in nineteen ten
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) READ Mister Forster READ
(pause_short) this is from the New York Times
in nineteen (pause_medium)
(pause_short) February nineteen eleven
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) for that his sense of character values is entirely adequate
(Hx) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) while there his blith blithe manner
and journalistic (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) wittiness of phrase serves him well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he invinces neither power nor inclination
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) which totally dis regre (pause_medium)
But what a different (pause_short) wording of a review
It's so (pause_short) proper
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) That was in nineteen ten
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) something that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it was ab brevi ated capital SPEC
(vocal_noises_laughter)
I don't know (pause_short) what it was
(pause_medium) READ But if his defects are exasperating
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Vivid characterization
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and a f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and a freakish (pause_short) humor
(pause_medium) The clash of modern culture
(pause_short) and modern materialism
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
Well this is from (pause_short) the Book Review Digest
(pause_short) So they have all of these little reviews
Oh I didn't know they had that at (pause_medium)
that they've (pause_short) collected
of (pause_medium)
I didn't (pause_medium)
Cause I took that uh (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I didn't spend too much time putting it together (vocal_noises_laughter)
But (pause_medium)
and modern (pause_short) materialism
(pause_medium) I mean that's essentially what we're saying
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So they (pause_medium)
That was (pause_medium)
even there they (vocal_noises_laughter) hit it on the head (vocal_noises_laughter)
(uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The the humor we're having a little trouble with though
(pause_short) well
(pause_medium) There were (pause_medium)
there were times when it w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it was under underlying humor
the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The like (pause_medium)
like the t (pause_medium)
(pause_short) in the movie at least
(pause_short) when the Basts come to the
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to the wedding reception
(pause_short) and
sits down there and (vocal_noises_laughter) starts shoveling in the food
and it's really (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's funny until then they have the confron tation with Henry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But it is kind of humorous
Well I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I was gonna tell you of the one oth (pause_medium)
(uh) young person
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was a former student
(pause_short) We were talking about the book
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or about the movie
(pause_short) He hadn't read the book
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but not a great movie
(pause_medium) And he said it was without passion
(pause_medium) Oh my
I don't know w (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
That's (pause_medium)
Uh (uh) yeah
(pause_short) uhuh
They are (pause_medium)
it's all kind of uh (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the confron tation with Leonard (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's not necessarily passion
the (pause_medium)
Well what uh (pause_medium)
NO but it was XX (pause_medium)
Well I think it (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Look at Margaret's uh
Well certainly there wasn't passion between (pause_medium) Henry (pause_short) and (pause_short) Margaret
(pause_medium) Yeah there was
but (pause_medium)
Strong (pause_medium)
I mean it isn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Ruth had (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Ruth had strong feelings for Howard's End
(pause_short) because it (pause_medium)
her (pause_short) bequest was ignored
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the rest of the people are just kind of (pause_short) floating along
(pause_short) Oh no no no no no
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Margaret's speech to Henry
(pause_short) in the whole world
(pause_medium) is one of the most passionate things I have ever read
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) absolutely
(vocal_noises_inhalation) oh I think there was a lot of feeling
(pause_short) a lot of feeling
(pause_medium) Was this novel popular when it was published
(pause_medium) Uh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) It is w (uh) one of the (uh)
(pause_medium) Tradition and change
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Back then
when they w (pause_medium)
Fitz (uh) gerald
and (uh)
(pause_short) Hemingway
(pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) And this book was written in nineteen ten
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't care for it
(pause_short) I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The (pause_short) the hi the big description about the dumb old umbrella
(pause_short) (LAUGHTER)
and did the umbrella have (uh)
(pause_short) for crying out
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) and the description of the music
we gr (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
Now that was supposed to be part of the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I did (pause_medium)
I did not enjoy (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Was that supposed to be humor
(pause_medium) I I (pause_medium)
(H) Or at least (pause_short) Helen and Margaret's humor
X (pause_short) above average
(pause_short) I just couldn't XXXX
(H) But I enjoyed (pause_short) the movie
(pause_short) Couldn't quite get into it
(pause_short) Yeah
Well Evelyn helped me (pause_short) stay with the book
(pause_short) Because she said it was written in a different time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and of course it's British
(pause_medium) and so
(pause_short) because I was having trouble getting started
I (pause_short) got hung up
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) when you were reading the review
(pause_short) did I get the right names
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And I thought
(pause_short) all that happened was
He (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
and they had (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and they had this understanding of the souls
(H) And (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what is the big deal about this
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

He (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) They talked about what makes a classic
(pause_short) Oh

(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as just a story about these people who are wanting to to live at this Howard's End
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or you can read it (pause_short) as the clash between the intellectual
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the practical
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or between (pause_short) England (pause_short) and Germany
(pause_short) Which is really what they're getting down to was the basis of that a
(pause_short) it can ap (pause_short) ply to England in nineteen ten
(pause_medium) or it can apply to America in nineteen ninety three

You forg (pause_medium)
I mean even the x (pause_medium)
The corporate income tax is going to be raised one (pause_short) percent
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so therefore the g big corporations in the U S are backing this budget change in Washington
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well

(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
That is as (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then it has to deal
(pause_short) with the big questions
(pause_medium) Uh the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) of moral values
(pause_short) and of w (pause_medium) how you (pause_medium) (uh) per ceive (vocal_noises_inhalation) the world

(pause_medium) looking out her window
(pause_medium) across the street
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And they seem to be a happy
(pause_medium) They seem to have a lot of interaction (vocal_noises_inhalation) going on in that family
It's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she saw
(uh)
(pause_medium) a happy family
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) had a good association with each other
(pause_medium) As she peeked out her window
(pause_medium) looking at this (uh) family
But (pause_medium)
Ruth (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Miss (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the first Missis Wilcox (pause_short) thought highly of her husband
(pause_medium) and Margaret thought highly of her
And do you remember when she was going to (pause_short) go down to Howard's End with her

(vocal_noises_inhalation) and Missis Wilcox said
(pause_short) well I'm so glad to see you

(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs
Okay (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) no one have to (pause_medium)

(vocal_noises_inhalation) that means there are only four more left
So you don't (pause_medium)

(pause_short) Okay
taken with (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now the spade
so now (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because I could take this trick
(vocal_noises_inhalation) high spades are dangerous because you might (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So if
(pause_short) yeah okay
Now I don't have (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Right

(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) the spade was led
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but there's a heart in this trick
(pause_medium) Because I don't wanna take this trick
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But that's easy
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) so you would have taken that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So now
I could still get under so (vocal_noises_exhalation)
Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)

So you (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Okay now
b two different people took (pause_short) hearts
if you t have all (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) if you take all the points
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's called
and you get (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you give everyone else (pause_short) twenty six points
(pause_medium) or else you're minus twenty six points
(pause_medium) And that's good
(pause_medium) Shooting the moon is really hard to do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now look it
(pause_medium) So you can throw a heart
(pause_medium) I don't have a club
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_short) somebody else did take hearts
(pause_medium) Or did he (pause_medium)

(pause_short) I thought ev someone else did take hearts
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
Queen of spades gonna have to come up m (pause_medium)

(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I might
(pause_medium) I don't have any aces here
(pause_short) I'm gonna pass a low heart
(pause_medium) Just so they can't shoot the moon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I got the ace of hearts

(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now the queen is the highest
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Two l (pause_medium)

(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) I have no spades whatsoever
(pause_medium) It's really good
(pause_medium) Play hear ts
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
So Erasmus laid the the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) And (um)
(pause_short) when you come then
(pause_short) to (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(uh)
(pause_short) This freedom of the will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) I think (uh)
let me read you a (pause_short) page from Brendler
(pause_short) Because it sets the sa stage very nicely
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (um)
(pause_medium) if you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this evening when you go home
(vocal_noises_exhalation) on on it more
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's on page three eleven
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
and then (pause_short) we can (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) READ Erasmus entitled his anti Luther pamphlet
(pause_medium) diatribe (pause_short) concerning free will
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Once again
(pause_medium) the first (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and fundamental questions
(pause_short) in April of fifteen eighteen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology
(pause_medium) Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate READ
(pause_medium) (TSK) And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) READ You alone
(pause_medium) Among all the others
(vocal_noises_inhalation) have recognized the key question
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you do not bore me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) With the Papacy
(pause_short) purgatory
(pause_short) indulgences
(pause_short) and similar nonsense
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you have put the razor to the throat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And for that (pause_short) I thank you heartily
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) thus Luther evalu (uh) evaluated the subject
And Erasmus commented on the significance (vocal_noises_inhalation) of their engagement
(pause_short) in battle
(pause_short) in his own style READ
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he wrote to Luther
READ (pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Perhaps an Erasmus (pause_medium) who writes (pause_medium) against you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will do more for the Gospel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) than certain dunderheads (pause_medium) who support you READ
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_short) READ humanistic thinking
(pause_short) this is Brendler now
obs (pause_medium)
(uh) on this (uh)
but this sets the stage for what we're gonna (pause_short) talk about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ humanistic thinking will never consent
(pause_medium) (TSK) Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) The author of (uh)
(pause_short) what is it
(pause_short) Q I am the master of my fate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I am the captain of my soul Q
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't think that he would (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) acknowledge original sin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ Is based READ (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and of itself not capable of any good will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) And that apart from grace alone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) free will is nothing
(pause_short) can do nothing
(pause_short) does nothing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) except depraved deeds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based
(pause_short) and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they do not appear (pause_medium) (SWALLOW) reconcilable with the dignity of man (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Catholic
(pause_medium) and semi pelagianism
(pause_medium) (TSK) with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) finally views
(pause_short) free will
(pause_short) as the decisive factor in attaining salvation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Thereby conceptualizing free will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as similar to a healthy (pause_short) man (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for how can a person
(vocal_noises_inhalation) be responsible for his deeds
(pause_short) if he possesses no free will READ
(pause_medium) This is what Erasmus asked
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) READ How can he decide between good and evil
(pause_medium) So reasoned Erasmus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Such arguments
(pause_medium) long known to Luther
(pause_medium) and many times (pause_short) presented to him
(pause_short) impressed him (vocal_noises_inhalation) not in the least
(pause_medium) (TSK) God alone is salvation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) God alone measures guilt
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He alone condemns
(pause_short) When he will
(pause_short) and whom he will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Man can only accept the divine judgment
(pause_medium) (TSK) This is in fact best
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And if by (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and it is by the divine prerogative
(pause_short) that man (pause_short) will (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) For God alone is infallible
(pause_short) and his being is grace and mercy
(pause_medium) (TSK) This concept
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that man is divinely elected to salvation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is the center of the predestination dogma
(pause_short) That later
(pause_short) the Geneva reformer Calvin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) made the center of his teaching
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that subsequently
(vocal_noises_inhalation) could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) (uh)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) P on page three twelve
(pause_short) when you read (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ Therefore
(pause_short) Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Such arguments
(vocal_noises_inhalation) given his theological orientation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as suspicious
(pause_short) From the very start
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because they originated from human nature
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Which exalted itself against God
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The whore (pause_short) reason
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Prefers to submit to the Devil
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Adjusts to all situations
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And proves (pause_short) everything
(pause_medium) Human nature
(pause_short) MRC does not (pause_short) possess (pause_short) free will MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It is like a horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ridden by God or the Devil
(pause_medium) The rider possesses the will
(pause_medium) The horse (pause_short) obeys READ
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well that's as clear as you can get it
(pause_medium) (TSK) Human nature is like a horse
(pause_medium) Ridden by God or the Devil
(pause_medium) The rider possesses free will
(pause_medium) The horse obeys
(pause_medium) Alright that
And as you come (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well let's look at the Scriptures
(pause_medium) (TSK) Now
(pause_short) number one
we have to admit first (pause_medium)
(pause_short) v first off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that there seem to be passages
(pause_short) are there not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (THROAT) Many
(pause_short) Which seem to teach
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Isn't that clear in the Scriptures
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Whosoever will may come
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) Jesus turned to his disciples
and (pause_short) seemed
because they were disappointed in (pause_short) some of his sayings
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they were offended by some of the things he said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and they walked no longer with him it said
(pause_medium) (TSK) And then he turned to those who remained
(pause_medium) They had a choice
(pause_medium) Will you go away
(pause_short) What do you will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And the will
(pause_short) apparently was
re resided in (pause_short) in these disciples
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so Erasmus is going to say
in Scripture we have (pause_short) paradox
(pause_medium) We have clear passages of Scripture
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which seem to indicate that man (pause_short) POUND has a free will
(pause_short) and that he can exercise POUND that will
(pause_short) to follow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) To respond or not to respond
(vocal_noises_inhalation) On the other hand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we have passages of Scripture
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which (pause_short) seem to indicate
(pause_medium) that the will is not free
(pause_medium) and that the
and that man i th is (pause_medium)
man is predestined (pause_short) by a (pause_short) an omnipotent sovereign will of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) We have to take both these pass (pause_medium)
(pause_short) We both accept the scriptural authority
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he says to Luther
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
I will not church (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I will not (pause_short) question
or I not (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because I understand you accept (vocal_noises_laughter) no Church Father authority
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if it is in disagreement with your opinion (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I will quote the only authority that you recognize
(pause_short) The Holy Scriptures
(pause_medium) (TSK) And so
(pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When God created Adam and Eve in the garden
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Now
(pause_short) and obviously God must have given
the first (vocal_noises_inhalation) created pair
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a choice
Because the whole (vocal_noises_inhalation) system (pause_short) of reward or punishment
(pause_short) is based upon the decision which is (pause_short) these individuals made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when Cain slew Abel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) Um
(pause_short) if you do well
(pause_short) Shall you not be s sustained
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Sin (pause_short) crouches at the door
(pause_medium) If you do well
(pause_medium) Apparently
(pause_medium) Cain (pause_short) had the ability
(pause_short) even after the mur (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he had the ability
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to make a positive choice
(pause_short) According to Erasmus
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Luther
(pause_short) (TSK) (um)
(pause_short) I'll g I'll I'll tell say some of the things that he he picked first
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (um)
(pause_short) he's gonna go all through the Scriptures
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) return return the prophets said
return (vocal_noises_inhalation) Hosea pleads with Gomer
(pause_short) please come back (pause_short) t_you see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) come back to the the husband of the covenant
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that you have a an ability
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to change the course that you're now taking
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that you can (pause_short) go this way
(pause_short) or you can go that way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(pause_short) then there are other arguments which are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) here's (uh)
here's one on (um)
(pause_medium) in this (uh)
this is the (um)
(pause_short) the actual (uh)
(pause_medium) wr writings of the s f (pause_short) freedom of the will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) here's he (pause_short) he uses Ecclesiastes
(pause_medium) God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from the b (pause_medium)
(pause_short) from the book
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ God made man from the beginning
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and left him in the hand of his own counsel
(pause_medium) (TSK) He added his commandments
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_short) precepts
(pause_medium) If thou would keep the commandments
(pause_short) and perform acceptable (pause_short) fidelity forever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) they shall (pause_short) preserve thee
(pause_medium) He hath set w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Stretch forth thy hand
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to which thou wilt
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Before man is life and death
(pause_medium) Good and evil
(pause_medium) That which he shall choose
(vocal_noises_inhalation) shall be given him READ
(pause_medium) Choose
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So Erasmus's argument is
(pause_short) you have a right to choose
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And therefore if you can choose
this presupposes (pause_medium) (TSK) that you have a free will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In any rate
(pause_medium) if (pause_short) man is
(pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) If (pause_short) if God has already determined
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that this person (pause_short) commits these acts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then (pause_short) there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor
(vocal_noises_inhalation) On the part of the perpetrator
Because how can a person be held responsible (vocal_noises_inhalation) for deeds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which he does
(pause_short) if he mself did not will those
the f (pause_medium)
but those (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If that is the case
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And if (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if the deeds which he commits
(pause_short) (SNIFF) This is (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) we'll (pause_short) look at another couple p (uh) of his passages
(pause_short) here it is
READ If the will (pause_short) were not free
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) sin could not be attributed to man
(pause_medium) (TSK) It ceases to be sin
(pause_medium) If it is not voluntary
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Free will is not extinct
(pause_medium) Though it has contracted a paralysis READ
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) How is it paralyzed
(pause_medium) See we all (pause_short) participate in the Adamic nature
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And this Adamic nature
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) in Adam
remember the New Eng (pause_short) New England primer
(SNIFF) So
(pause_short) has been passed on to all generations of humans
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so therefore while we (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we have a free will
it is (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It's not the will (pause_short) that was there
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's not the will
(pause_medium) that (uh)
(pause_medium) that Adam had
(pause_medium) Because (pause_short) it no longer (pause_short) has the freedom (pause_short) that Adam had
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So the human will
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Uh Erasmus admits that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
that (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) God then enables
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That God will provide a prevenient grace
(pause_medium) A prevenient grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that (um)
(pause_medium) that God will give me a prevenient grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which will (pause_short) enable me
(pause_short) to move toward (pause_short) this salvation
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And if I then respond
(pause_short) positively
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) To the gift of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then (pause_short) God will extend (pause_short) the exemplary grace to me
(pause_short) which enables me (pause_medium) to acquire salvation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So prevenient grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) If you respond on the path
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then God extends the exemplary grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which will lead you home
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He uses a little story
(pause_medium) A little (pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) allegory
(pause_short) Or figure I guess
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (TSK) Uh there (uh) there's a n (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) there's a tot
(pause_short) a toddler
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (TSK) Uh
(pause_medium) but he's got to be (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) big enough to appreciate apples
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) Because
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) his
(vocal_noises_inhalation) alright
(vocal_noises_laughter) because that's the
that's part of the story (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There a (pause_short) nice (pause_short) shiny (pause_short) apple
(pause_short) Over here
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Over here
(pause_medium) And this (pause_short) little (pause_short) tot
(pause_medium) he sees the apple
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And he (uh)
(pause_short) he needs
(pause_short) he wants to get to this apple
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) so he starts (pause_medium) in the direction of the apple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
what (pause_short) is the prevenient grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which (pause_short) doesn't (pause_short) take him (pause_short) to the apple
(pause_short) doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) b but (pause_medium)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) goes along with him
making sure that he (pause_short) he doesn't fall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he just
(pause_short) he lets him get there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But (pause_short) he just (pause_short) more or less
(vocal_noises_inhalation) supports or sustains the little tot
in his motion (pause_short) toward the apple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So the little tot you see
(pause_medium) (TSK) Has decided he wants the apple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Prevenient grace assists him (pause_short) toward that apple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It doesn't
(pause_short) as I said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it doesn't (pause_short) go get the apple and bring it to him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he must go to the apple
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if he
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) if he half way to the apple
(pause_medium) if he (pause_short) if he sees something he th considers more attractive
(pause_short) and he goes off on a tangent
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then you see
(pause_short) then his will has decided that he does not want to cooperate
(pause_medium) With prevenient grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Luther hated that word cooperation
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now Luther's position is
(pause_short) we are dead (pause_medium) in trespasses and sin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You see
(pause_short) There is (vocal_noises_inhalation) nothing (vocal_noises_inhalation) that can (pause_short) come to us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with this fear of the righteousness of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The righteousness of God
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That so called L Turmerlebnis L
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The tower experience
(pause_medium) (TSK) Where reading in Romans one seventeen
(pause_medium) he read
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_medium) (THROAT) (pause_medium) the j the just (pause_short) shall live by faith
(pause_short) you have to take rea really read Romans one sixteen first
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) Um
(pause_short) READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) For it is the power of God onto salvation
(pause_medium) To everyone that believeth
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) to the Jew first
(pause_medium) and also to the Greek
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For therein READ
(pause_medium) therein
(vocal_noises_inhalation) READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For therein
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is the righteousness of God revealed
(pause_medium) As it is written
(pause_medium) MRC The just (pause_short) shall live (pause_short) by faith MRC READ
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) But this one time when he read it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he said
(pause_medium) suddenly it dawned on him
(pause_medium) What this meant
(pause_medium) Q And this place in Paul Q
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the gate of paradise Q
(pause_medium) L Es ging mir ein Licht auf L
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) The light broke in on me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And what was this light
(pause_medium) (TSK) That the righteousness of God
(pause_medium) is passive righteousness
(pause_short) It's not the righteousness
Q I hated that (pause_short) that phrase righteousness of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What does righteousness of God mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Righteousness of God means
(vocal_noises_inhalation) God is holy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I'm a sinner
(pause_medium) And I can never stand in his presence
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And the gulf between us can never be bridged
(pause_short) and he's gonna cast me into Hell
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God Q
So you see he was constantly (vocal_noises_inhalation) preoccupied with this thought
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of somehow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) satisfying the righteousness of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Through some work
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Through some indulgence
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Through some prayer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
if a m m (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it would have been I
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if ever a monk
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because he d he did everything
(pause_short) that he thought would
(pause_short) would make God respond (pause_short) sympathetically to him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he was always miserable
(pause_medium) (TSK) And then he discovered
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's nothing that I do
(pause_medium) It's what I accept in faith
(pause_short) Namely
(pause_medium) the sacrifice of Christ
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I reach out
(pause_short) I accept that
(pause_medium) as my (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and (pause_short) and then the righteousness of God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is (pause_short) imputed to me
(pause_medium) It's given to me
(pause_medium) The (pause_short) MRC the just (vocal_noises_inhalation) shall live (pause_short) by faith MRC
(pause_medium) And so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this life (pause_short) in God comes to you not
(pause_short) ot
it's not God (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that (pause_short) that was the image that Luther had
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what do I have to do to placate him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And now you see the breakthrough comes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Luther
he's coming at it from an angle of a (pause_short) of an Augustinian monk
This agony and anguish (vocal_noises_inhalation) of looking for this God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he is
(pause_short) after this discovery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he is going to (pause_short) detest (vocal_noises_inhalation) anything (pause_short) in theology
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which smacks of (vocal_noises_inhalation) human effort
(pause_medium) or human work
(pause_medium) sufficient (pause_medium) to please God
(pause_short) or to placate God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_medium) There is nothing you can do to please God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) God (pause_short) loves you
(pause_short) he gives you his grace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) totally (vocal_noises_inhalation) out of his grace
(pause_short) and nothing from your merit
(pause_medium) So the human will (vocal_noises_inhalation) cannot
(pause_short) you cannot decide (vocal_noises_inhalation) to accept God
(pause_medium) Even the gift of faith
It's interesting in (um)
(pause_short) (TSK) in Bonifas
in his book (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But it's still
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Where he's in one of the camps
(pause_medium) (TSK) and it's very
(uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in this camp
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you just wanna give up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you're hanging onto life (pause_medium) by your (pause_short) fingernails
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And um
(pause_short) he said
(pause_medium) every day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that (um)
(pause_short) I I prayed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he said then it came to me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That (pause_short) what sustains me in this situation
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) what sustains me
(pause_short) is my
(pause_medium) MRC my deep faith (pause_short) in God MRC
P (pause_medium) And then he said
(pause_medium) and then it dawned on me
(pause_medium) that this deep faith
(pause_medium) is not (pause_medium) my creation
(pause_medium) Well that's interesting
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) This faith (pause_medium) was given me
(pause_medium) I did not create it
(pause_medium) I did not conjure it up
(pause_medium) it came to me
(pause_medium) It was given to me
(pause_medium) That's the testimony of a Huguenot
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Inmate (pause_short) in a concentration camp P
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well let's take a break
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I Just wanted to go over the changes in the schedule
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um originally
(pause_short) we were going to require the (um)
(pause_medium) request for statement of interest and qualifications to come (pause_short) back to
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) twenty North Clark Street
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) but the
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community
(pause_medium) more time
(pause_medium) a weekend
(pause_short) two days
(pause_medium) to (uh) (pause_medium) augment (pause_short) whatever application people were gonna submit
so the due date is changed from (pause_short) April (pause_short) seventh
(pause_short) to April eleventh
(pause_medium) And you can drop off those proposals at twenty North Clark Street
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
the same (pause_short) process (pause_medium) will continue
(pause_short) but for the changes in the time
at the time that you (pause_short) drop off your proposal
(pause_short) you will be scheduled for a (uh) (pause_short) public (pause_short) meeting
(pause_medium) where you will be given a chance and an opportunity to present your (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) proposal
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um right now we're looking at April fifteenth
and s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and April sixteenth
(pause_short) as the (uh) date for that public presentation
(pause_short) and we don't know
(pause_short) where that will be held
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) During April seventeen to the twenty third
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_short) during the week of (uh) A pril twen ty fifth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) to go over how that zone was selected
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_medium) the place date and time for that meeting (pause_short) will also be announced
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Um
(pause_short) from May second to June third
(pause_short) for the empower ment zone
(pause_medium) will be developed
(pause_short) with the community
(pause_medium) and during the week of June sixth
(um)
(pause_short) on the (uh) empowerment zone application
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the place date and time (pause_short) will be announced
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) and on June thirtieth
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) for selection by HUD as an empowerment zone for Chicago
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) is if there are no other questions
(um)
(pause_medium) yes sir
(pause_medium) I have a question
(pause_short) Worst case scenario
(pause_medium) After we submit em
(pause_medium) the (uh) the proposal application
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) organizations being what they are
(pause_medium) what (pause_short) will the coordinating council
(pause_medium) when there's a hue and cry
(pause_medium) from those who attempting (pause_medium) to empower themselves
(pause_medium) and combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power
(pause_medium) Who say unfair
(pause_medium) this (pause_medium) wasn't done right
(pause_medium) according to (pause_medium) our perspective
(pause_medium) or this that and the other
(pause_medium) that would be the worst case scenar io
(pause_medium)
What can (pause_short) the city
what (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) what can the coordinating council
(pause_medium) or what's gonna be p (pause_medium)
(pause_short) be in place
(pause_medium) to (pause_medium) listen to all the criticisms
(pause_short) all of the (pause_medium) disappointments at
(pause_short) not being selected
(pause_medium) so that
(pause_medium) let's say optimistically
(pause_short) there are some good ideas
(pause_medium) some oversight
(pause_medium) hopefully that's (pause_medium) of minor proportion
(pause_medium) So that
(pause_medium) we can still keep the city
(pause_medium) running smoothly
(pause_medium) and becoming more and more beautiful
(pause_medium) I don't know if that issue has been discussed by the (um) coordinating council
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) I w y would be willing to take that back
(pause_short) I mean the worst thing would be for
(pause_short) HUD not to recognize that this is a c collaborative effort
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) I mean it wouldn't bode well
(pause_medium) for Chicago to get an empowerment zone if
(pause_short) if everyone (pause_short) were not supportive and on board
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) I mean that answers your question
(pause_short) in that case would be
(pause_medium) But we'll (pause_short) definitely take that message back
(pause_medium) on that question I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) my (pause_short) individual worst case scenario
(pause_medium) and any other worst case scenarios
that they (pause_short) collectively might come up with
(pause_medium) Notwithstanding Paul XX's suggestion
(pause_medium) that the empowerment zone (pause_medium) moneys
(pause_medium) CTA green line
(pause_medium) be utilized
(pause_short) effectively and efficiently
(pause_medium) to get a bigger bang for the buck
(pause_medium) kay XX
(pause_short) I just wanted to say that
(pause_short) there's also some other opportunities for
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) organizations that are new
(pause_short) in the networking process
and the more (pause_medium) organizations
(pause_medium) that hear your voice
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) There's (uh)
(pause_medium) a networking meeting going on
(pause_short) on Friday
(pause_medium) at nine thirty in the morning
(pause_medium) And it's (pause_short) free
(pause_medium) It's it's a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) it's (pause_short) a group of assist and nonassist agencies
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_short) organizations like CRCC
(pause_medium) the Mega Center
(pause_short) Women's Business Development Center
(pause_medium) Small Business Development Center
(pause_medium) But I think that
(pause_short) anybody who belongs to an organization
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) that (pause_medium) has any type of (pause_short) connection with the city
(pause_short) it would be good to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) This one is Friday
(pause_medium) at nine thirty at the Mega Center
(pause_medium) The bank
(pause_short) (pause_short) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) on the seventh floor
(pause_medium) At what time
(pause_medium) Nine
(pause_medium) I'm sorry
(pause_medium) Okay
I I (pause_short) I I have a clue that she gave me
but I'll (pause_medium) make arrangements on it
(pause_medium) The lady in the yellow sweater
Actually I was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) again I was trying to reframe his concerns in the best case scenario
(pause_medium) you feel that
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) could divide the city
(pause_short) Best case scenario would be the (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) provisions were made
(pause_medium) such that the ideas that come out
(pause_medium) and let them (pause_short) continue
(pause_short) That (pause_short) that some reassurance of what comes out of it
(um)
(pause_medium) from the city of Chicago
(pause_short) I think the city is (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I mean I know the city is committed to that
and I know that that has come up at the i (um)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the coordinating council meeting
(pause_medium) continue to work
(pause_medium) with people
(pause_medium) no matter what happens
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) other kinds of funds
that could be (pause_short) put towards implementing
(uh)
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) areas (pause_medium)
(pause_short) plans in areas that are not selected
(um)
and that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that certainly has been the spirit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of the (um) (pause_short) coordinating council
(pause_medium) You
(pause_medium) I've got (uh) (pause_short) three questions (pause_short) for you
(pause_medium) and I suppose your response is gonna just (pause_short) kinda XX on there
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) does the city have any idea how many (uh)
(pause_medium) requests they're gonna (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Do you have an estim ation
(pause_medium) So
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
s (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Uh well that kind of leads into my (pause_medium)
(pause_short) my next question I think touches on (pause_short) these people's questions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) it seemed like it would behoove us all
if there were some kind of (pause_short) consensus building process before
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) this went on and
(pause_medium) So what people are saying
(pause_short) community organiza (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) community
(uh)
(pause_short) group meetings
(pause_short) But
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) from what I understand of this empowerment zone (pause_short) process
the idea is to really (pause_short) involve things on a g grassroots level
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) my two concerns on par (pause_medium)
(pause_short) are one
(pause_medium) that
(pause_medium) a and I voiced this concern with elder Jarret when
(pause_short) (uh) last month at the
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) Washington (pause_medium)
or (uh) Washington Library Center when they
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) that is
(pause_medium) simply (pause_medium) throwing this out into the community and saying that
(pause_medium) you expect the community to be able to respond
(pause_short) Community groups to be able to respond to you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is
(pause_medium) I think it at l at least
(pause_medium) (uh) instrument for (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) (COUGH)
I think that that's the expecta tion of the (pause_medium)
It doesn't (pause_medium)
it doesn't address (pause_medium)
(pause_short) one
(pause_short) community organizations
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
and many are (pause_short) of them being service providers
(pause_short) do not necessarily have
(pause_medium) the same (pause_medium) goals
(pause_short) in mind
they've got different (pause_short) priorities
they've got different (pause_short) purposes
(pause_medium) than
(pause_medium) members of the r the community themselves
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) the second thing is that
(pause_short) people who do not live
(pause_short) directly inside
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zones
(pause_medium) they've got an overriding concern in this because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as Mr Pollack said
(pause_medium) To be able to make these things work
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that this is calling for
(pause_medium) there're gonna be a lot of community (pause_medium) resources
(pause_short) s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) from the federal government
(pause_medium) from the state
(pause_medium) county
(pause_medium) and city
that are gonna need to be (pause_short) marshalled
(pause_short) reallocated to this area
(pause_medium) And to be able to have a consensus
not just within (pause_short) the empowerment zone
(pause_medium) Are gonna be provided and maintained
(pause_medium) over the ten years
(pause_medium) through different administrations
(pause_medium) through different aldermen
(pause_medium) political processes
(pause_short) involved
(pause_medium) these people are not being brought into the decision making process beforehand
(pause_medium) And I think this speaks to these people's concern
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The (pause_medium)
this (pause_short) this r (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know their names
So I'll just have to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) woman in yellow
(pause_medium) gentleman here in the glasses
(pause_medium) there's gonna be h
(pause_short) (uh) earlier that very first speaker
gentleman (uh)
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) that you're gonna be receiving a number of (pause_medium) proposals
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) you say you don't know how many
(pause_medium) twenty eight (pause_short) thirty two people that you said
(pause_medium) maybe a hundred proposals
(pause_medium) within a week's time
(pause_medium) and be able to (pause_medium) arrive at one (pause_medium) selected empowerment zone
(pause_medium) it seems to me that it (pause_short) be much more beneficial
(pause_short) if the entire community as a whole
(pause_medium) was brought into this process
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) this is what I'm bringing up is
(pause_medium) True community based citizen participation
(pause_medium) would involve ongoing series of meeting
(pause_medium) that I would think that the (pause_medium) coordinating council would be (pause_medium) promoting
(pause_short) would be organizing and directing on an ngoing e ven nightly basis
(pause_short) That's not exact ly grassroot (pause_medium) planning
to be (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) grassroot planning
(pause_medium) But they need a forum
they need (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if this woman here today did not speak up
Let me (pause_short) try to respond to your ques tion sir
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) what you're suggesting is not a grassroot
a grassroot (pause_medium) process
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Secondly
(pause_medium) we only have
(pause_medium) till June thirtieth to submit an application
(pause_short) A really (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) a true strategic planning process
(pause_short) takes many more months than that
(pause_medium) Many more years than we have
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
we have to do the best that we (pause_short) can do
(pause_medium) And all I'm saying is
(pause_short) I don't believe a forum
is being presented for community groups to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is not being promoted by the city
this is not being (vocal_noises_inhalation) publicized as a forum (pause_short) as a (pause_medium)
I don't know (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) onprofit
(pause_short) affordable housing provider on the West Side
He said he hasn't even XXX (pause_medium)
(pause_short) has not even been contacted
(pause_short) and I had a meeting with PRIDE last week
I said they're not being (pause_medium)
they're not being contacted by y (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) as far as being brought into a network
(pause_medium) for this
I'm trying to raise (pause_short) issues and concerns
The second (pause_medium)
my second qu (pause_medium)
(pause_short) If they're interested in this
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the city obviously's got its own priorities
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) funds already allocated in budget
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) my question as far as the process is c (pause_medium)
(pause_short) are (um)
(pause_medium) what (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) How much weight are gonna be given to
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) proposals
which (pause_short) dovetail into (pause_short) existing programs
(pause_short) that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas
(pause_short) and how much is the city willing to bend and say
(pause_medium) I will g (pause_medium)
we are gonna forego (pause_medium) these (uh) (pause_short) scheduled or proposed projects
to be able to dovetail into (pause_short) empowerment zones
(pause_medium) What's being said
(pause_medium) when is the city going to present
(pause_medium) its overall plan
(pause_short) their seat
(pause_short) in the auditorium
(pause_short) or their (pause_short) place around the table
(pause_medium) and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development
(pause_short) when will their interests be served
(pause_medium) so
(pause_medium) this empowerment zone
(pause_medium) Go ahead
(pause_medium) Well to (pause_medium)
let me answer your question in terms of the (um)
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) proposed plans
(pause_short) I mean right now
(pause_medium) the (pause_medium) (um) coordinating council
(pause_medium) that is received from the community
(pause_medium) And obviously there (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) there are (pause_medium) other issues to look at
(pause_short) for example
(pause_medium) (um)
organizations that may be involved in (pause_short) (um) (pause_short) current work
(pause_medium) their ability
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean all that is getting (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is thrown in the pot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I don't think that any (pause_short) community that has an existing plan
(pause_short) has a leg up
(pause_medium) on any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) are they explaining the (uh) (pause_medium)
for example I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) don't know if Londa White is here
s (uh) theoretical (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) at a (uh)
(pause_medium) a (pause_short) (uh) community meeting last month
in which (uh) a lot of (uh) selection criteria were
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) drawn up
if is the council (pause_medium) gonna absorb that into the selection process also
has (uh)
and the council has seen portions of (uh)
(pause_medium) of the Seaway principles
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some of those principles have been (pause_medium)
(pause_short) are included in what we have tonight
(pause_short) Others are really principles
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and how the makeup of the zone will be
(pause_medium) And that is going to be handed out to the (uh) (pause_short) Coordinating Council
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) m m my third question is on the final program
(pause_medium) I (pause_short) think this gentleman again spoke very
(pause_short) very adequately to it
(pause_short) um
(pause_short) it seems to me
(pause_medium) this idea of building consensus
(pause_medium) That
(pause_short) if we're able to make this (pause_medium)
over (pause_short) such a long time
(pause_medium) That the city (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and in fact it's stated in the (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh)
the (uh) (pause_short) HUD (pause_medium) application proposal that
(pause_medium) the (uh)
(pause_medium) governing body
(pause_medium) making the application
(pause_short) must provide a (pause_short) ssurance and evidence
that this (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh) empowerment zone plan
(pause_medium) one of the (pause_medium) most fundawen (pause_short) fundamental and best ways to have this done
(pause_medium) would be for the city to come up with a com prehensive plan
(pause_short) that follows guidelines
that would (pause_medium) ensure
(pause_medium) that what's happening in the empowerment zone
and be able to be dis (pause_medium) distributed to other areas of the city and
(pause_medium) and built on in other areas of the city
(pause_short) does the city have (pause_short) any
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) plans
(uh) any any (pause_medium) hope of
(pause_short) coming up with a comprehensive plan
(pause_medium) We do not have a comprehensive plan for (pause_short) the city of Chicago
(pause_medium) Does the city have
(pause_short) We have
(pause_short) and we have been identifying (vocal_noises_inhalation) places
(pause_medium) that have plans
(pause_short) and (pause_short) trying to get things done
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A comprehensive plan
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) the infusion of (pause_short) many many dollars
(pause_short) much more than is available
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) within the city budget
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) in how we invest our money
(pause_medium) and the empowerment zone is an e is an example
(pause_medium) of an of an area where we are going to (pause_short) do some strategic planning along with the community
(pause_medium) Correct
(pause_medium) we only have policy guidelines
and when (pause_medium)
(pause_short) when administrations change
(pause_short) policies change
(pause_medium) What I'm talking about is that
(pause_medium) cities that we are competing against
(pause_short) San Antonio
(pause_short) they've got
(pause_medium) comprehensive plans
(pause_medium) And
that (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) Alright
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) my point is
(pause_medium) The ones that I just mentioned do
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) my (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) my point is
(pause_medium) that
it it (pause_short) it seems to me that
it would give us as (pause_short) Chicago
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a much better footing with government
(pause_short) that these things are going to be
(pause_short) Well sir
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and considering that between now and then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) I'm not quite sure where to go with your question
(pause_short) (COUGH) (COUGH)
(pause_medium) Oh I'm s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm sorry
(pause_short) go ahead
(pause_short) Bernie
I ha (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I just wanted to make a friendly (pause_short) remind
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) My name's Derek Williams
I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm with the HORN association of men
(pause_short) and (uh)
(pause_medium) I I think we need to recognize that (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh) this is an opportunity
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) consensus do not build themselves
(pause_short) And
(pause_medium) the only reason that we're all in this room is because we heard
(pause_short) about a hundred million dollars
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) it's impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan
(pause_medium) First of all
(pause_medium) And I think we just need to
(pause_medium) given the information that's out there
(pause_medium) we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) be honestly speaking with you
(pause_medium) (uh) I come from an organization with (pause_medium) five hundred members
(pause_medium) and empowerment zone has (pause_short) absolutely no meaning
(pause_medium) to just about eighty percent of our population
(pause_medium) For the simple reason
(pause_medium) we get caught up in
(pause_medium) in in all of the rhetoric
(pause_short) um
(pause_short) we we constantly challenge each other
and I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I I think we should be trying to focus on
(pause_medium) the information that's available
(pause_medium) and and and meet the challenge
(pause_short) And in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and again
(pause_medium) to (pause_short) meet the challenge
(pause_short) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_medium) Thanks Derek
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um Paul
(pause_medium) Derek I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I appreciate following you
(pause_short) Thanks
(pause_medium) Well see I'd've been kinda (pause_medium) frustrated
(pause_medium) I'd like to
(pause_medium) set the record straight
(pause_medium) and what they are not
(pause_medium) according to my own (pause_medium) understanding
(pause_medium) The empowerment zones
(pause_medium) were (pause_medium) implemented
(pause_medium) under the Clinton administration
(pause_medium) They did not start (pause_medium) under the Clinton administration
(pause_medium) They started in the state of Illinois
(pause_medium) as enterprise zones
(pause_medium) The difference between (pause_short) empowerment zones
(pause_medium) and enterprise zones
(pause_medium) for twelve years
(pause_short) Congress never did approve
(pause_medium) enterprise zones
(pause_short) at the federal level
(pause_medium) By the time they were approved
(pause_medium) Congress
(pause_medium) attached (pause_medium) funding
(pause_medium) criteria
(pause_medium) and shifted the name from enterprise zones
(pause_medium) to empowerment zones
(pause_medium) For the record
(pause_medium) I do not live (pause_short) in CHA
(pause_medium) I am not (pause_medium) homeless
(pause_medium) I do not (pause_short) transport myself
(pause_medium) on CTA properties
(pause_medium) I'm a veteran
(pause_short) so I do not go (pause_medium) to county hospitals
(pause_medium) I abide by the law
(pause_medium) so I'm not in (pause_short) county jail
(pause_medium) I have (pause_medium) attended (pause_short) several colleges
(pause_medium) I think successfully
(pause_medium) they think (pause_short) unsuccessfully
(pause_medium) so I do not need (pause_short) the public education system
(pause_medium) in Chicago
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) I do know
who does_( uz ) (pause_short) need em
(pause_medium) The homeless
(pause_medium) and people not in (pause_short) public housing
(pause_medium) Public housing
(pause_medium) because one
(pause_short) we're getting ready
(pause_medium) What are we gonna do with it
(pause_medium) The city (pause_short) has no right
(pause_medium) would be in a fight
(pause_medium) we need
(pause_medium) to try and tell me
(pause_medium) what my block needs
(pause_medium) When my block decides
(pause_short) what it needs
(pause_medium) and presents its plan
(pause_medium) to the city
(pause_medium) then the city
(pause_short) can take its logical
(pause_medium) legal
(pause_medium) jurisprudence
(pause_medium) course
(pause_medium) of identifying
(pause_medium) what (pause_short) resources it has
(pause_short) and make em available
(pause_medium) The empowerment zones
(pause_medium) what are
(pause_short) by legislation
(pause_medium) to be planned
(pause_medium) by
(pause_medium) with
(pause_medium) and for
(pause_medium) those most in need of empowering
(pause_medium) It don't mention
(pause_medium) those agencies
(pause_short) most in need
(vocal_noises_inhalation) See the entitlement programs is what has turned the West Side
(vocal_noises_inhalation) into a damn desert (pause_short) of oasis and poverty
(pause_medium) Because the West Side was planned (pause_short) for
(pause_medium) CHA was planned (pause_short) for
(pause_medium) The city (pause_short) has put together in a aggregate sum
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the map that is about two pages
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that shows you where the poorest folks live
(pause_medium) If you are an agency
(pause_medium) that is involved in those areas
(pause_medium) take the opportunity to find out what those people need
(pause_short) and deliver the proposal
(pause_medium) If you are an agency that is outside of those areas
(pause_medium) then
(pause_short) change your location
(pause_medium) do like Reagan said
(pause_medium) and move with your feet (pause_short) into the area
(pause_medium) This is no
(pause_medium) We already know
(pause_short) where the most MRC empower (pause_short) less (pause_short) people (pause_short) are MRC
(pause_medium) Get busy
(pause_medium) Patty asked a question earlier
(pause_medium) I have (pause_short) chose not to do it
(pause_medium) but out of necessity
(pause_medium) I'm gonna ask you to (pause_short) walk through this
(pause_medium) this is where the poor folks live
(pause_medium) This is where your tax dollars are going
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And this is why you get upset
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because you say
(pause_short) it comes in over budget
(pause_medium) This is where the state (pause_short) has roads going on
(pause_medium) This is where county hospital has roads going on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So as far as I'm concerned
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if the city did anything more than what it was doing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would file a grievance with the Department of Justice
to say that they were in violation (pause_short) of the legislation
(pause_medium) The legislation says that
(pause_short) those who have nothing
(pause_medium) are either to be courted (pause_short) by those who have something
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or left alone
(pause_medium) so that they can develop
(pause_short) their own plan
(pause_medium) or their failure
(pause_medium) That to me (pause_short) is the empowerment zone
(pause_medium) Anything else
(pause_short) is a contradiction
(pause_medium) Malcolm
we (pause_short) sitting in the college named after him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he said by whatever means necessary
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get gautonomous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) touched
(pause_short) contagious
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in in love with (pause_medium) poor folks
(pause_medium) is what is gonna take
(pause_short) to keep your agencies
(pause_medium) empowered
(pause_medium) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) before we close
we have (uh) several members of the Coordinating Council here
and see if they (pause_medium) want to add anything
before we (pause_short) leave (uh) (pause_short) here tonight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) we have Sproule White
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_short) Wanda White
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and Ted Wysaki
(pause_short) (uh)
the Chicago Association of Neighborhood Development (pause_short) Organizations
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from Continental Bank
(pause_short) And also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee
(pause_medium) Do you wanna say anything
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) I'll just (pause_medium) make one point
(pause_medium) Cool
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright folks (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Well alreet (hx)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I would like to (pause_short) talk to you about these three items
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some ice in a pan
(vocal_noises_inhalation) water in this glass
(pause_short) and steam rising from this pot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Now
(pause_medium) I would like to ask you
(pause_short) Tell me please
(vocal_noises_inhalation) How are they all alike
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) These three things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This water in this glass
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Correct
(pause_medium) They are all forms of water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I told you there was water in this glass
(pause_short) and you have all seen water boil at home
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But now let's try to figure out how they're different
(vocal_noises_inhalation) first
(pause_short) is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) about (uh) twenty four (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The temperature of this w water here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the temperature of this steam
(pause_medium) PAR I know it's hotter than that PAR
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) Fahrenheit
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We call it a
(pause_medium) Solid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Very good
You should g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You should go out on the road there
(pause_medium) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) We are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Y (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh well
(pause_short) I'm glad to meet you
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yes
(pause_medium) Of course we call it a sholids
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The shape that it starts out with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And what do we call something that you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that you can splish splash
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yes
(pause_medium) Liquid
And a liquid (pause_short) can change its shape
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) to f completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And finally
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Correct
And a gas completely fills whatever shape container (vocal_noises_inhalation) you put it in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from a solid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to a liquid
(pause_short) to a gas
(pause_medium) and back and forth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Woo
(vocal_noises_inhalation) add (pause_short) or subtract energy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) heat
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) change the temperature
(pause_medium) Alright
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When you change the temperature
and that's where these (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX balloons VOX come in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I have here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a number of balloons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX into this little itty bitty container here VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) everybody count together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you think
(pause_short) well
(pause_medium) okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm glad I never saw d Citizen Cane with you
(pause_medium) VOX Rosebud is a sled VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) let's all count together folks
(pause_medium) One
(vocal_noises_inhalation) very good
One balloon going into the (vocal_noises_inhalation) little container here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) two
Two balloons going into the (vocal_noises_inhalation) little container here
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Ah VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Oh no VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here
(pause_short) XX XXXXXX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh stop guessing at what this is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Let's have some suspense here
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_medium) Three
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Three
Three balloons going onto the the (pause_medium) little container there
(pause_short) Three
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And now
(pause_medium) this would be
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Everybody tell him what this is
(pause_medium) Seven
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX it's four VOX
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Boy you people (pause_short) didn't watch enough Sesame Street as a child
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This would be
(pause_medium) Five
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Thank you very much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Down
(pause_medium) Down
(pause_medium) ah VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And this (pause_short) would be
(pause_medium) Six
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Six
And let's do this (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In Spanish it would be
(pause_short) L O cho L
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) L S seis
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm afraid for our nation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) and this would be
(pause_medium) L Siete L
(vocal_noises_inhalation) thank you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Seven
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And finally
(pause_medium) Eight
(pause_medium) and (uh) L huit L in French
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I thought you were telling me your breakfast
What you had for b (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) L Huit L
(pause_short) Very good
(pause_short) Oh my gosh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) eight balloons into this little container here
(pause_short) I bet you're wondering r how that happened
(pause_medium) There's a hole in it
(pause_medium) there's a hole
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there's no hole in the counter at all
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) you're getting a little ahead of me son
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Let's all figure it out together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And we can get a better idea of what's happening to the balloons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You're (pause_medium)
What y what (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Y (pause_medium)
(pause_short) This is really terrible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm gonna take some of this hot (vocal_noises_inhalation) water here
and pour it into this (vocal_noises_inhalation) flask here
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) And put a balloon over the top (pause_short) of the flask
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) VOX Ah VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX my Bunsen (vocal_noises_inhalation) burner VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Does it use real Bunsen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright here we go
(pause_medium) There we go
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Alright
but let's (vocal_noises_inhalation) behave like scientists now
(pause_short) and (pause_short) watch
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_medium) Folks
(pause_medium) What do we see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we can see
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) condensation here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) On the sides of this flask
(pause_medium) Rising up from the water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) making (pause_short) the balloon (pause_short) blow up
(pause_medium) Woo
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh we can also start to see (vocal_noises_inhalation) bubbles in the water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask
(vocal_noises_inhalation) turned into a gas
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That had enough force
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to fill up (vocal_noises_inhalation) this balloon
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's what we call boiling folks
Turning from a liquid (vocal_noises_inhalation) into (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) a gas
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now if I took the t balloon
(pause_short) if I took the balloon off the top of this flask here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) what do you think would happen to the water
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It would freeze and turn into a
(pause_medium) Solid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Solid
(pause_short) But it would still be water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Whether it's a solid
Well water is made up of (pause_short) atoms
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Yeah VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Solids
(vocal_noises_inhalation) liquids
(pause_short) gasses
(vocal_noises_inhalation) two atoms of what ato (uh) (pause_short) element
(pause_short) Hydrogen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Very good
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_medium) one atom of what
(pause_short) Oxygen
(pause_short) Oxygen
(pause_short) I know you wanted to say it
but (pause_short) he's my pet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_short) VOX VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK)
A all these atoms (pause_short) combine to form (pause_short) a molecule of water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's what a molecule is folk
(vocal_noises_inhalation) hanging out
(pause_short) Having a good time together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they call the water molecule (pause_short) aich two o
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) (TSK) Folks
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) How do you suppose the molecules in this water
I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'll miss you PAR
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
are different from the molecules in the water (vocal_noises_inhalation) when it's a liquid
and different still from the water (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) from the molecules in the water when it's steam
(pause_medium) Do you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Yes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's right
it's th (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but in everything in the universe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Even you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But to get a better understanding of how those molecules interact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) let's pretend these ping pong balls here (vocal_noises_inhalation) are molecules
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well folks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In a solid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like this ice here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The molecules are moving (vocal_noises_inhalation) very slowly
(pause_medium) And they're very close together
(pause_short) in fact (pause_short) they're in a v (pause_short) MRC joined uniform state MRC
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_short) slowly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in a solid
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the molecules are moving a little more quickly
(pause_medium) Okay
So you have some (pause_short) fluidity of movement within a fixed volume
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
they're a little more (pause_short) further apart there
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but in a gas
(pause_medium) VOX look at that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're moving very quickly indeed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're moving so fast they completely fill the shape container
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's what it's like in a gas
(pause_medium) VOX And temperature is a measurement of how fast (pause_short) or slow (vocal_noises_inhalation) molecules are moving VOX
So if you have (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX slow moving molecules VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what temperature do you have people
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Yes
(pause_short) cold
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And if you have fast moving molecules
(pause_medium) Hot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Hot or high temperature VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You're right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But not every substance becomes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a liquid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as water does
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that brings us back to the mystery (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX of our disappearing balloons VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) I am losing my (pause_medium) spheres
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Inside this container
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm going to take some of that liquid
and examine it much in the same way that I did (vocal_noises_inhalation) the water
(pause_medium) VOX (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's watch now and see what occurs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm going to pour this liquid into this flask here
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and again
and see what we (pause_medium) notice
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now here (pause_medium) is a liquid
(pause_medium) That is bubbling and steaming
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when there were the f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) when there was a flame underneath it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there's no flame underneath this (pause_short) liquid here
(pause_medium) N_that's different
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's see
(pause_short) what happens when I put a balloon over the top
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) If we do in fact have a liquid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX we do VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It is filling up the balloon here
(pause_short) But
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) This steam here is very cold
And we can see that frost (vocal_noises_inhalation) is forming
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Frost
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) My God VOX (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's curious
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Fighting over balloons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm going to put this probe here into this liquid
and we will see what temperature (vocal_noises_inhalation) this balloon is
Uh try to (pause_short) stay in your seats
I don't want you guys to run up (pause_short) throughout the show
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) three hundred and twenty three degrees below zero
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Water becomes a solid at thirty two degrees above zero
And it remains a solid (vocal_noises_inhalation) at every tenjure temperature below that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this (pause_short) three hundred and twenty three degree liquid
(pause_medium) is (pause_short) water
(pause_short) No
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No
This (pause_short) folks (pause_short) is (pause_short) liquid (vocal_noises_inhalation) nitrogen
(pause_short) VOX Ah yes VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Where folks can you find (pause_medium) lots of nitrogen
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) In (pause_medium)
(pause_short) oing this
(pause_medium) the air you're breathing right now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) The air is probably about seventy percent nitrogen
and (uh)
(pause_short) it's oxygen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) okay
(pause_short) Our body takes it all in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But we only use the oxygen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as it is doing this flask here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) those molecules are moving much faster
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The (pause_short) nitrogen is warmer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) VOX this (pause_medium) liquid (pause_short) is very cold indeed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_medium) to get exactly
(pause_medium) to get an idea about how cold that is
let's use these two (pause_medium) bouncing rubber balls
(vocal_noises_inhalation) examine the balls
(pause_medium) To let me know if
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they are in fact
(pause_medium) average normal everyday balls
(pause_medium) Testify for the audience
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) You've really haven't been fed
(pause_medium) No
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Right under the water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm surprised I caught that
Normally I'm (pause_short) f_try to goof
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but this time I caught it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
when one of these balls goes into the VOX liquid (vocal_noises_inhalation) nitrogen VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with me
(pause_medium) Where it's nice and warm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Well let's think now about what's happening to this ball
(pause_medium) It's in the VOX very cold VOX liquid nitrogen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) What do you think is happening to the ball
Is the ball getting hotter (vocal_noises_inhalation) or colder
(pause_short) Colder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Colder
(pause_medium) PAR some people don't agree with you
(pause_short) In fact most people don't PAR
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So if the ball is getting colder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) are going faster
(pause_medium) Or slower
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Slower
And that (pause_short) you all (pause_short) concur
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) do you think (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and the ball is getting colder
do you think the ball is becoming (vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC more of a solid MRC
(pause_short) Or more of a liquid
(pause_short) Liquid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A liquid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) if (uh)
sh (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if what this guy is thinking is true
I will take this ball VOX out VOX (vocal_noises_inhalation) of the liquid nitrogen
and we will begin (pause_medium) the experiments
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) Let's see
(pause_medium) they look alike
they still look (pause_short) pretty much the same
let's see (vocal_noises_inhalation) if they bounce (pause_short) as before
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well this one (pause_short) m (pause_short) bounces pretty much the same
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That is curious
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I must continue my study
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's see how they react under (pause_medium) VOX pressure VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (GRUNT)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) alright
this one (pause_short) pretty much (pause_short) is absorbing my energy
(pause_medium) VOX (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) VOX No VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It broke
(pause_medium) You see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) closer together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The ball became more of a solid than before
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Well folks
that (pause_short) kinda k (pause_medium)
it (pause_short) gives you a little bit of an idea of what's happening to our balloons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we'll see what happens to this (pause_medium) VOX big old balloon
(pause_short) When it interacts with liquid nitrogen VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_medium) Rather than see what happens tha there and (pause_medium)
(pause_short) guess at what's happening to these (pause_short) balloons in the container
we will see what happens (vocal_noises_inhalation) to a balloon
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So the balloon and its contents
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay those molecules are slowing down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and so they're getting closer and closer together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You still have the same number of air molecules inside this balloon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as you did before
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're going slower
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in this (vocal_noises_inhalation) balloon
(pause_medium) And look (pause_short) at the balloon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) At the very bottom of it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's the air people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) The molecules have gotten so (pause_short) slowed down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're less
(pause_short) they're not in the (pause_short) as much in the form of a gas now
they're more in the form (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_inhalation) of a liquid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But now
(pause_short) The air around it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is causing those molecules to speed up
(pause_medium) VOX (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ha ha
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And so
(pause_medium) the molecules are speeding up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and taking up more space inside the balloon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So that has to be what's happening (vocal_noises_inhalation) to the balloons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) Yes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and so those molecules slowed down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and got closer together
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the air
(pause_medium) took up less space inside the balloons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) into this HI little itty bitty container HI
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX But now VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm taking the balloons out (pause_short) of this container
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so the molecules (pause_short) are speeding up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The air is VOX heating up VOX
(pause_short) okay
(pause_short) And so the molecules are going (vocal_noises_inhalation) faster and faster
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they're taking up less space
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) inside (pause_medium)
taking (pause_short) up more and more space
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And you might want to protect your eardrums
(pause_medium) I get quite shell shocked at the end of the day
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) this really teaches us a lot people
this tells us that the dif ference (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) The difference in a substance between a solid (pause_short) a liquid and a gas
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) like water
(pause_medium) how fast the molecules are moving
And that different (pause_medium) substances become a solid
(pause_medium) a liquid
(pause_short) and a gas at different temperatures
and temperature (vocal_noises_inhalation) is a measurement of how fast or slow (vocal_noises_inhalation) molecules are moving
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's what I wanted to tell you people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if you have any questions about this
or (pause_short) any other subject
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) even if you don't
(pause_short) I certainly hope you have a great day here at the Museum (pause_medium) of Science (pause_medium) VOX and Industry(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) VOX (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) VOX thank you very much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)Oy VOX

(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I miss you
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Hm
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) I'm good
Is she (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Unhunh
(pause_medium) (TSK) I'm so glad
(TSK) Aw
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) m
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) gosh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's been so long
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then there was relief
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then there was ecstasy
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) No
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'll (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
tell me what (pause_medium)
The reas (pause_medium)
I have (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I kinda
(pause_medium) (TSK) I wasn't inclined to (pause_short) call you
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Like I felt like
(pause_medium) Totally
(H) (pause_short) you know
so that's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I let (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) I hadn't told you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But my period is really late
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) we would talk
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (pause_medium)
You were getting nervous (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) and it's been so (pause_short) long
And so it's like (pause_short) eight days late
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I thought
I'm (pause_short) positive
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) to even (pause_short) try to check
(pause_short) Yeah
(H) (pause_short) And (pause_short) (um)
so we went (pause_short) to go get (pause_short) an EPT
(pause_medium) at (pause_short) pregnancy test
And then (pause_short) we d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) And then
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) of course it came out fine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So that's the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) y you can't be pregnant
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No
which (pause_short) I doubt
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) I think that would be really rare
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) th (pause_short) you know what I mean
(pause_medium) would it come out nega (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Like would a negative
(pause_short) You know what I'm saying
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) M
Like could you get (pause_medium)
Is it possible that you could still be posi (pause_short) positive
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think (pause_short) there'd be a slight chance
(pause_short) of it being a false (pause_short) negative
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_short) I don't think so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) where I would have
(pause_short) like
(pause_short) enough of (pause_short) the hormone that (pause_short) the pregnancy test tests for
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think I would have enough of that in my urine
that (pause_short) of course it would show up
(pause_short) if I had any in there
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
So I (pause_medium)
I I'm pret (pause_medium)
I took that as a pretty good (vocal_noises_inhalation) sign
(pause_medium) Oh my god
how come you've been (pause_short) keeping all this in side
(pause_short) I didn't mean to keep it in side
I mean (pause_medium)
I didn't mean (pause_medium)
(TSK) Oh (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I didn't think it was a (pause_short) huge deal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but then
(pause_medium) I guess I wasn't trying
(pause_medium) I think I was in a (pause_short) bit of denial
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
then (pause_short) I would go get the test
(pause_short) So is that all the drama
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that (pause_short) was the relief
(pause_short) Really
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(vocal_noises_laughter) Oh
Little bunny is going through the (pause_short) whole wide spectrum of emotions
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
like (pause_short) what if it came back positive
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then that would mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then I thought gosh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
like I hadn't (pause_short) warned you
(pause_short) Totally
I thought (pause_short) oh my gosh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was even g (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I thought
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) of cour (pause_medium)
Like I'm know I (pause_short) wouldn't (pause_short) have (pause_short) it or anything
but I thought if the slight chance (pause_short) I would have it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) would n't they love to see (pause_short) the photograph of the EPT
(pause_medium) Knowing that (pause_short) that was like its first sign of life
(vocal_noises_laughter) Oh my g (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I know it's kind of (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short)
Kind of (pause_short) spooky
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

(vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe somewhere down the road
(vocal_noises_inhalation) me too
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
I was very (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But it was just a thought that went through my head
(vocal_noises_laughter) No that's a very cute thought
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
Cho (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Know what's even better
(pause_short) What
(pause_short) You could do like a self timer
(pause_medium) A self timer
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) With you right next to it
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) A self (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm the mom
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Oh gosh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh gosh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) The (pause_short) test right there
(vocal_noises_exhalation) Aw
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Anyhow
(pause_short) So how are you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's really beautiful here
(pause_short) It's like (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we walked around
and we just (pause_short) (TSK) talked
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) we had such a nice day
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) We went out for dinner with Joy
(pause_medium) Aw
(pause_short) great
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Oh I see
(pause_short) Yeah and I have it on Monday too
(pause_short) Gotcha
Wh Jill's leaving (pause_short) tomorrow
(pause_medium) Aw
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) What are you guys doing
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Just talking
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Just talk ing
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We have a lot to catch up on
(pause_short) Nothing
(pause_short) Nothing
(pause_short) Just homework
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Oh
I and I (pause_short) just talked to this (pause_medium) Asian guy
(vocal_noises_exhalation) um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who's twenty (vocal_noises_exhalation) six years old
(pause_medium) (TSK) he's a very sweet guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) we just
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) we just got in one of those (pause_short) conversations where (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you just talk about everything
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) everything from Norm (pause_medium)
(um)
(vocal_noises_laughter) that's a basketball player PAR
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I said Norm
instead of like (pause_short) President (pause_short) Nixon
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from Nixon
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_short) he's a Catholic
(pause_medium) (TSK) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_medium) but (pause_medium)
and (pause_short) pro life
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Wait
he said he's (pause_short) pro capital punishment
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and pro life
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well see the
(pause_short) th those little en
(pause_short) the little
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_short) embryos
(pause_medium) (TSK) They don't have a (pause_short) decis (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They can't make a decision
(pause_medium) You know
people who (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) commit crimes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
that (pause_short) calls for the death penalty
(pause_short) they brought it upon themselves
(pause_medium) Oh wait
(pause_short) Jeff
JILL_S I'm (pause_short) gonna go over there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh you are
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) She's going next door
(pause_short) Who
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) Yeah we're gonna go hang out there
(pause_medium) With who wh who
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We're gonna go (pause_short) hang out next door
(pause_short) Right
Has Jill been (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
I put it back (pause_medium) in the closet
(pause_short) (TSK) M (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
We spent some ti (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) up folded
(pause_medium) up there high
(pause_short) Yup
(pause_medium) (TSK) Um
(pause_medium) Okay so (uh)
(pause_short) Jilly's going next door
(pause_medium) She says bye
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) (TSK) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) She (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) we hung out with Donna
and (pause_short) they hit it off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
we went out to dinner with Joy (pause_short) tonight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and she's met everybody
(pause_medium) Grea t
How does (um)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) How's Jill
(vocal_noises_exhalation) How's her state of mind

(pause_medium) M
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Know what Rob's doing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Rob (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) decided that he just needed a vacation or something
So (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he (pause_short) took off for (pause_short) Big Bear
(pause_medium) You're kidding
he just took (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he found a cabin
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) Big Bear Lake
(pause_medium) You're kidding
(vocal_noises_exhalation) just the cabin with like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) four beds in it
(pause_medium) But
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) and he's staying there for a few nights
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) just (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
get in tune with him (pause_short) with himself
(pause_medium) (TSK) Oh no

So he went from like the romantic (pause_short) sexual getaway
(vocal_noises_laughter)
a soul searching (pause_short) (SNIFF) bond with nature (pause_short) type of (vocal_noises_exhalation) deal
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)

Condense it down to (pause_short) a minute
(pause_short) we said something (pause_short) so funny today
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I thought when (pause_short) Jill said it
(pause_short) it captured you so well
(pause_short) cause I think
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it was just so funny how well we both know you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) I guess we were talking about
(pause_medium) I don't know what came up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) yeah
(pause_short) you like to watch MASH
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) she laughed and said
(pause_short) can't you just picture Jeff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) sitting on his couch
(pause_short) and watching MASH
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with some orange juice
(pause_short) with ice cubes
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) and Jill went
(pause_short) that's Jeff's slice of heaven
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we just thought it was so funny
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) like
(pause_short) it really captured you
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we both know you'd be sitting there with orange juice with ice cube s
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Only
(pause_medium) I haven't had ice cubes here since (pause_short) September
(pause_medium) Are you serious
(pause_short) I just don't even bother
or (pause_short) Or
(pause_short) I keep it really cool
(pause_short) it's cold enough for me
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) So you're absolutely right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I go through like a carton (vocal_noises_inhalation) of orange juice
(pause_short) every two days
(pause_short) (TSK) (pause_medium) Honey
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Impressive
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know what I just realized
and she d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she didn't see me
(pause_medium) Really
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) I waved at her and
(pause_short) she just (pause_short) kept going
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe (pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) if there's a reflection or something
(pause_medium) What a body she has
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Isn't that incredible
(pause_medium) it's like
(pause_medium) she's evolving
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it's funny
Or (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) degenerating
Degener (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Oh but di (pause_medium)
I d (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
I know you would (pause_short) you get excited about things like this too
(vocal_noises_inhalation) about the (pause_medium) (um) planets
(pause_medium) cir (pause_short) circulating around other stars
There's irr (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) irreb (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) irred
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) There's proof
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) What's the
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Irrefutable
(H) (vocal_noises_laughter) What's the word that goes before proof (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) There
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I could just see myself like lecturing to a bunch of people and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) oh honey
(pause_short) What's that word that
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
that goes before (pause_short) honor
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) wouldn't that be funny
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Wouldn't that be funny
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) they looked at you (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Q is my wife (pause_short) here Q
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Q Oh honey
what wor (pause_short) were we talking about the other night
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) I think it's so funny
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Can I run this by you real ly quick
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) There's (pause_short) this scientist
(pause_short) that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there are
(pause_medium) there (pause_short) they found two planets circulating around (pause_medium) a sun
(pause_medium) Or (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in the universe
(pause_medium) outside of our (pause_short) solar system
(pause_medium) BR WI Really WI BR
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) And so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) which like made me think
(pause_medium) you know like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know like how we have always talked about life being out there
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) You know
an a theory that there were planets going around (pause_short) other (pause_medium) stars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
Actually tha I I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No I didn't
(pause_short) I just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I just (pause_short) thought that it was like pretty much factual
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_exhalation)
you know that (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) we have always (pause_short) thought that
(pause_medium) M
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like the scientist who who does it
(pause_short) they make this leap
(pause_short) of faith
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) M hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) around other suns
Just (pause_short) by the sheer numbers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well what are the (pause_medium) chances
then (pause_short) chances are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
even if it takes like one in (pause_short) a million chance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like we have millions and millions and billions of (pause_short) opportunities
to have that (pause_short) happen
(pause_medium) Un hunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think that's the whole thing
(pause_short) would always go yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) he would say that
(pause_short) Unhunh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like w in what galaxy
Like what (pause_short) solar (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Like what (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Santa Barbara
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
I don't know the (pause_short) the details
But (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
what it (pause_short) made me (pause_short) think about was
(SNIFF) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the fact that
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) like (pause_short) I
I'm very passionate about (pause_medium) certain ideas
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) you know what I mean
How (pause_medium)
And then you're like more (vocal_noises_inhalation) scientific
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) open (pause_short) to other possibilities
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Unhunh
(pause_short) You know like in
like (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know like you're ch
(pause_short) um
(pause_short) just (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
Like you would (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) (TSK) it's like
(pause_medium) you know like the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Oh I don't know
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That
(pause_short) and now
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and so (pause_short) I can be satisfied
That (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you can assume something that feels
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) really (pause_short) orrect
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Sure
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(GASP) (pause_short) Uh yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) I feel like (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) well if you also felt that
(pause_short) (SNIFF) (pause_short) I don't know
you could feel something that (pause_medium) wouldn't be proved right
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) no
but I think that's so (pause_short) exciting honey
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't see that in the news paper
(pause_short) Oh (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I did (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I mean
I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm s (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
I think it's (pause_short) that exciting
(vocal_noises_laughter) Oh my God (vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) I mean like I feel like it's (pause_medium)
I want to go read it (pause_short) in the newspaper for myself
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Like how come it's not on the news
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I know
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) they
(pause_medium) they circle the (pause_short) the their star
(pause_short) they think that there's not
(vocal_noises_exhalation) it can't
(pause_short) those planets can't sustain life
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) No
From (pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) like
(pause_short) from their surface
(pause_short) The (pause_short) the planet's surface
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) Oh
(pause_short) They can HI see that HI
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like they pick up heat waves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it's just
(pause_short) obviously they can't se really see anything
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
They (pause_medium)
(pause_short) are out there are
just (pause_short) by radio waves
And (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) and how (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) God
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I t i it's unbelievable
how (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) man has
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) From this little point
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in the whole universe
(pause_short) we've been able to tell so much
just with (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) science
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Just with
(pause_medium) aw
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) That sends me out there
(pause_medium) Wow
(vocal_noises_exhalation)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Totally
(pause_short) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) No
I'm s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Y you were convinced you were pregnant
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) I only got convinced the moment before (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I was waiting for the results
Like (pause_short) all before that
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) well I'm late
(pause_short) But I don't feel any of the symptoms
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I got so nervous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was kind of not treating it
(pause_medium) taking it that seriously
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it's such an un (pause_short) believable concept
(pause_short) So I was n't really (pause_short) believing it
(pause_short) And then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but the moment that I did the test
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this isn't kidding around
like you (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) No
like she wa (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) but
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) it was
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) Are you sure it would have been mine
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (H)

(pause_medium) (TSK) Oh honey
it (pause_short) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Right
Well they're coming out with (pause_short) condoms for women
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Right
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
I think those are the grossest contraptions (pause_short) ever

(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)

(vocal_noises_laughter) XX
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(um)
a physician come and (pause_short) talk to us
about (vocal_noises_inhalation) all the different kinds of (pause_short) contraception
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) to tell us about R U four eighty six
Is that the (pause_short) drug
and (pause_short) the side effects of everything
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (SNIFF)
(pause_short) (TSK) Yeah
Well is R U (um) (pause_short) forty six
(pause_medium) is that gonna (pause_medium) be implemented
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) it's not available here in the United States
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Right (pause_medium)
(pause_short) are they
(pause_short) are there (pause_short) people trying to make it law here
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think so
(pause_short) I just think
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) I doubt (pause_short) it will be
(pause_short) for a while
(pause_short) Such a bum mer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's such a great
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That would be so great if people could get that
(pause_short) Oh yeah
Stay away from those (pause_short) pro lifers
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Throwing things at em
(pause_short) (TSK) Oh
(pause_short) I know I know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know what sweetie
(pause_short) she's probably (pause_short) doesn't know anybody

well give (pause_medium)
It (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Excuse me
(pause_medium) ((DOG_BARKING_BEGINS))
(pause_medium) Hey
(pause_medium) Are you Larry
(pause_medium) Are you Larry
(pause_medium) Yes
Are you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You're the guy
(pause_medium) Hunh
(pause_short) You're the guy to talk to then
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't know if I had the right place
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) Yeah
you got it (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) I just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) What are you doing there
(vocal_noises_laughter) You're probably trying t (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) VOX Yeah this is strange
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) I'm putting water in a (pause_medium) twenty six gallon container
inside my (pause_medium) truck
(pause_medium) Wow
(pause_short) That's quite a p (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and I have to spray the road
(pause_short) Ah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Cause the road (pause_short) before (pause_short) you can drive on it
it needs (pause_medium) more (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) more (pause_medium) stability
(pause_medium) Evidently
(pause_medium) So give me one second to lock this thing
(pause_short) keep the dust down
(pause_medium) well (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) it's not that so much
it's (uh)
(pause_medium) they put a (uh)
(pause_medium) a type of (uh) (pause_short) base on it that needs water and
(pause_medium) that just hasn't happened yet
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So there's some chemical reaction that has to take place
(pause_short) I guess (pause_medium) P a good a (pause_medium) analogy P
(pause_medium) Chelsea
(pause_medium) ((DOG_BARKING_ENDS))
(pause_short) That should hold it in there
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Nice to meet you
(pause_short) Seth
(pause_short) Here's my card here
(pause_short) Thanks Seth
(pause_medium) I think it's warming up a bit here
(pause_medium) Is this the house we're looking at
(pause_medium) I'll take you down in the basement
(pause_medium) Is the furnace down in the basement
(pause_medium) What's left of it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) We had all these (pause_medium)
Is it a (pause_short) old system
(pause_short) Yeah (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) We had the asbestos (uh) all removed from it and
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_short) Oh really
(pause_medium) so that's been done
I was j (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I was just at a place that does asbestos removal
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) where
Cal (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Cal Tech
(pause_short) they're the guys that did it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) Are they
(pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (H )
No they're (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they've got an office here in Nappa
(pause_medium) Cal Tech
What was the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Synergy
(pause_short) That's who
(pause_short) Dif (pause_short) different one
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Cause I was wondering t (pause_medium)
So where's the man with the (uh) (pause_short) camera
and the (pause_medium)
Oh I got the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I got my record er right here
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) That's pretty clever
(pause_medium) Yeah
my brother is (uh)
(pause_medium) teaches linguistics
(pause_medium) and they just want (pause_medium) business conversations
(pause_medium) alright
(pause_short) Well
(pause_medium) Wow
(pause_medium) Here's the animal (hx)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
They took (pause_medium) (uh) some of it with em obviously
Did this used to be (pause_medium)
(pause_short) used to be an old oil
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) I think it was an old
(pause_medium) I think it was an old
(pause_medium) see the (pause_short) oil THUMP tank THUMP here
(pause_medium) That's what my guess is
(pause_medium) And (uh) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) do you have a flashlight on you
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) then you get duct work
(pause_short) Or is this the flue
(pause_short) What they did
and they cleaned em up (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So you can tie right into em
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) So this used to have asbestos
Was there a (vocal_noises_inhalation) a plenum on top of here
(pause_medium) Yeah
with these (vocal_noises_inhalation) stack that went this way
un underneath there to the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) to the (uh) (pause_short) kitchen
(pause_medium) there are there are different (pause_medium)
(pause_short) there are different ones
(pause_medium) I see one r
(pause_medium) is that one right there
it might be (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) It kinda looks like it
And then there was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and then there is this THUMP one here THUMP
(pause_medium) So you have one two three
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) at least (pause_short) two there
and then there's another one (pause_short) way down
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know if you can see it or not
(pause_short) but it's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) it's up into the kitchen
(pause_medium) So there's probably three back there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) no but
(pause_short) what what we (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we want to p you to (pause_short) kinda give us an idea
You wanna add a c (pause_medium)
(pause_short) add a few more
(pause_medium) Back
(pause_short) Is that one way back
(pause_medium) Can't see it
(pause_medium) XX (pause_short) get this thing
To help (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to a point
looks like they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) I don't see any back in here
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well there's there's definitely one back there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now there's nothing out here
and this is where we feel we (pause_medium) we should add one
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Is
(pause_short) this is a
(pause_short) gonna be a dining room
(pause_medium) okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
one for (pause_medium)
one (pause_short) there (pause_short) for sure
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) what about above this section of the house
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) let me show you that
And you can give (pause_medium)
Now (uh)
(pause_short) you are on propane
(pause_medium) out here
(pause_short) This is natural gas
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Oh good
(pause_short) Kinda rare
(pause_short) That's good
because (uh)
(pause_short) the problem with propane is that
they wouldn't be able to v (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the co (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the county would probably have a problem with it
(pause_medium) Yeah
I can put a (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Do you want me to remove the old furnace
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) We'll not (pause_short) have to
(pause_short) No (uh)
(pause_short) do you want me to remove it
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
No that's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Well y the new furnace w (pause_short) would be much smaller
(pause_medium) That much I can guarantee you
(pause_medium) Alright
Do you (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) How many square feet is the house
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) Approximately
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) I have a roof guy coming about this time too
(pause_medium) You're doing the roof
(pause_short) we know who it is
(pause_medium) Getting a new roof put on too
Well I (pause_short) got some problems with (pause_medium) leakage in certain areas
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Okay this is (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) this is one right here
(pause_medium) See
(pause_medium) I'm wondering if
(pause_short) you don't have a floor plan of the house
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) We don't
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) We didn't get anything when we bought this baby (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I'm wondering if I should just sketch it out
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) Two story
(pause_short) Th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Okay
So all those st (pause_medium)
(pause_short) all those stubs that were (pause_medium) behind us
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK)
as long as I don't have to do (vocal_noises_inhalation) any ducting to the second floor
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) They only (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) which are on the ground level
(pause_medium) How about that one right there
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) That's one as well
(pause_medium) And then the return is (pause_short) back here
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) Good sized return
(pause_short) Yeah
Now you're not looking at (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) adding air conditioning
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) we would like to have that as an option
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Yeah
if (pause_short) if you don't wanna do it now
(pause_medium) you can
(pause_short) what they call
(pause_short) prep for air conditioning
(pause_medium) See you've got the furnace and the coil
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(pause_medium) when you add air conditioning in the future
(pause_medium) all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit
(pause_medium) and refrigerant piping to that coil
(pause_medium) So it (pause_short) saves (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it saves additional work in the future
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) if you're thinking about doing it in the future
It only (pause_short) costs about three hundred fifty dollars for the coil
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_short) It's the it's the out door air conditioning that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) write that in there
anyway in the (pause_short) in the quote
(pause_medium) (TSK) And now that's the (pause_short) the dining room you wanna add
If you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) we're gonna be making changes to the (pause_medium) to the house too
so we're (pause_short) keeping that in mind
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Is this accessible
(pause_medium) oh yeah
I wonder (pause_medium)
(pause_short) was this added on you think
(pause_short) maybe
(pause_medium) I'm just wondering if that foun dation wall
M (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It might've been
(pause_short) I wonder if I can get (pause_short) into this
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Oh okay
(pause_short) Good
(pause_short) Shoot I'd probab ly go with two registers in this room
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium)
and one (pause_short) one there
(pause_medium) Cause it's a good sized room with a lot of glass
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) Or you could do it
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) Okay
on the two (pause_short) two out side (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) into one Y branch
(pause_short) you know like the room
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) the room is shaped somewhat like this
(pause_medium) I could put like one there
(pause_medium) one there
is maybe (pause_medium)
(pause_short) tie those together like that
(pause_short) See this this (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) all we wanna know is
(pause_medium) is that we can eventually be able to do this
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) To to get (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) get this (pause_medium) duct work done
when we do (pause_medium)
when we do the modification to the (pause_medium)
Not (pause_short) not in this room
(pause_short) XX (pause_short) do it in the future
We m (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Uh I I hate to see us do it
Where are gonna be your (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) although if we do it in the sidewalls
(pause_medium) Oh we might take this out
(pause_short) and we might push this out further
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) well
(pause_medium) h
(pause_medium) P let's see
(pause_short) that's the guest house
(pause_medium) Where is that sucker P (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Dining room
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) Yeah
I (pause_medium)
It's right (pause_medium)
i (pause_medium)
(pause_short) here it i here it i here it is right here
you can see that (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is the current wall
so are you gonna go out like (pause_short) three feet or so
So we might (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we might (pause_medium)
(pause_short) we might (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) do a little modification
a tape (pause_short) tapered (uh) (pause_short) corners
(pause_short) A tapered corner there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So we might do (pause_short) a little (pause_short) of that
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) if you're gonna (pause_medium) put it in h (pause_short) this end wall
(pause_short) maybe it wouldn't be affected
(pause_medium) That one might down there
(pause_short) Because
we might (uh)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See eventually we have s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Cause I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) cause we're looking at right there
(pause_medium) course
(pause_short) now you gonna go out (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's right
that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that that that's going out to this master
(pause_short) which is gonna go up on the hill
(pause_medium) Aw
so you'll need (pause_medium)
(pause_short) What about (pause_short) heating for that
(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) what we're gonna do is put (uh) (pause_short) radiated heat
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) That'll be a slab floor then
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) I that's a that's a good point
I've (pause_short) I I'm not (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) we were th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The only thing is
(pause_short) I don't know how long
is that gonna be like (pause_medium) in the future
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Probably
Cause it would be nice to have heat in here (vocal_noises_inhalation) in the meantime
(pause_medium) I mean say you do the furnace
(pause_medium) It would be nice to have it (pause_short) for this winter
(pause_medium) Put that as a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) But one thing you can do
(pause_medium) I mean say we put the register right (pause_medium) here
(pause_short) and that's gonna b (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) that would obviously have to be moved
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but it's not gonna be a major change
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) And this one you may not have to move at all
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) But then that's probably how I'd do it
some (pause_short) something like that
if I had the registers (pause_short) going that way
(pause_medium) that might be the best way to do it
(pause_medium) It'd be like for fourteen by six
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (SNIFF) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) and then the furnace
it's somewhere over there (vocal_noises_exhalation) in that area
Furnace (pause_short) is (pause_medium)
(pause_short) over in this
(pause_medium) this corner over here
(pause_medium) That's where the furnace is
(pause_medium) One
(pause_medium) Two
(pause_short) Probab ly right (pause_medium) in here
(pause_medium) And now (pause_medium)
That's probably what (pause_medium)
That's about thirty (pause_medium)
is th (pause_short) is the how noisy the furnace is
(pause_medium) That's a real concern to me
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_short) if they're all (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I know there's pulse type furnaces
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's a loud one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I've had problems
(pause_medium) If I go with a (uh)
(pause_medium) Carrier furnace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The return grill's plenty big enough
(pause_short) yeah
I mean I can't (pause_medium)
and a (pause_medium)
and that's normally when you get (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you get (pause_short) a lot of noise (pause_short) in the house
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is if your (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) if your (uh) (pause_medium) ducts are too small
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) are either
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) air noise
(pause_short) which is due to undersized grills
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The other source of noise is th (pause_short) is the fan motor itself
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
In the in the actual (pause_medium)
(pause_short) In the (pause_short) unit itself
just having flexible duct between the unit (pause_short) and the d and the registers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it would be noisy
(pause_short) Yeah
But we're going d (pause_medium)
I'm not sure how it (pause_short) connects
(pause_medium) did we see that down there
(pause_medium) I'll have to go down and take a look at that again but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I imagine it goes down
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) then I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) then I can (uh) (pause_medium) eliminate th (pause_short) the noise problem
(pause_short) Alright
(pause_medium) So it's basically thirty by thirty
(pause_medium) return air
(pause_medium) Thirty by thirty return air
(pause_medium) And this is a (uh)
and I'd (pause_medium)
I would say not (pause_medium)
(pause_short) not placed
(pause_short) not placed very well
(pause_medium) This is (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) this is the supply
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) See
and I'd (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Where would you suggest (pause_short) they would go
If (uh)
(pause_short) if we put (uh)
(pause_medium) Boy
(pause_short) I would say g
(pause_medium) I'd put one on each side
(pause_medium) and maybe underneath that window
(pause_medium) Be nice to put it behind the couch
but then you've (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And you thi (pause_medium)
you so you (pause_short) you p you try and put em under windows
where (pause_short) that's where your (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) Yeah
I try to put em on (pause_short) the cold (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)
basically the coldest part of the room (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Because (uh)
(pause_medium) it just helps
y (pause_short) because otherwise
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you end up having cold spots on the sides
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so it never really
It wouldn't get out circulating through (pause_medium)
it never really blows out (pause_short) to the corners
So that's why I try to put it (pause_short) as far away (vocal_noises_inhalation) on the perimeter
(pause_medium) Okay
well this is the on ly (pause_medium)
So I don't know if you'd wanna (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the only the only other addition room
(pause_medium) And I'd
(pause_short) I don't know if
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) floor registers
Are there (pause_medium)
are th i i i is d does it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that's not a good idea these days
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) XX
you wouldn't be able to (vocal_noises_inhalation) put any kind of ceiling register in
(pause_medium) Cause you get the second floor
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) But th (pause_medium)
you're talking about wall regis (pause_medium)
(pause_short) putting em in the wall here
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) Yeah to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) to go in the wall
would be (pause_short) pretty tough
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Well I hate to do it right there
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) But to get in the wall would be almost (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I mean you can do that during new construction
but it's tough (pause_short) when you're coming back after the fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) and it's just too tough to get in there
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) And then (uh)
(pause_short) Uh
it's kinda like a lo (pause_medium)
kinda a little (pause_medium) parlor
(pause_medium) resembles (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) XXX
(pause_medium) XXXX
(pause_medium) This is a register
(pause_medium) Cause it's (pause_short) under there
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) the bathroom has a register
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) now that was it
(pause_short) XXX
How about the (uh) thermostat
(pause_medium) This guy
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) I would definitely go with a new thermostat
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Kind of a (pause_short) antique
But that's probably a good (pause_medium)
(pause_short) that's probably a good spot
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) I don't know
(pause_short) I i are we doing the right (pause_medium)
Is that what (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) well
(pause_short) I guess you haven't really (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
you haven't (pause_short) r really lived in the house (pause_short) during the winter
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's what we th (pause_medium)
if there's a (pause_medium)
(uh) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) with heating certain areas
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_medium) so I sa (pause_medium)
like that b (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in the past
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) Do you think it's pretty cool in there (vocal_noises_laughter)
Just (pause_short) that one grill
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then this guy has a (pause_medium) register
(pause_medium) yeah
(pause_short) I n I think that's gonna go
(pause_medium) Well (uh)
(pause_short) especially if you get the forced air (H) heating and cooling
(pause_short) One little guy there
(pause_short) Yeah see these aren't (pause_medium) strategically placed either
but you've (pause_short) pretty much got no choice
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) On most of these
these (pause_medium)
it's almost impossible to (pause_medium) to change these now
(pause_medium) but really on the second floor
(pause_medium) This one's not too bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the heat (pause_short) the heat's gonna rise
(pause_short) from the first floor anyway
Yeah up to (pause_medium)
So I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Typically
(pause_short) Mm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well see that's what we wanted to do
(pause_medium) Certain (pause_short) certain areas
Like if w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) One of the things we could do
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Oh they do
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_medium) So you can close off (pause_medium)
(pause_short) So that's how it's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah you can close off individual d (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (H)
and then the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) then it'll force the air what
(pause_short) Down into (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Downstairs
is close off (pause_short) too many of em
(pause_medium) Cause then you put a strain on the (pause_medium)
Cause (pause_short) cause then you're (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for the furnace to work properly
(pause_medium) And if you reduce the airflow too much
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) then it won't have enough air going across (pause_short) the heat exchanger
and it'll (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it'll overheat the heat exchanger
(pause_short) Really
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) So I would say
you don't want to close more than (uh)
(pause_medium) more than about twenty five percent of em
(pause_medium) Or you can close em
if you close em (uh) a a hundred percent
(pause_medium) you probably don't want to shut more than (hx) twenty five percent of em
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Which would b (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm not sure
(vocal_noises_inhalation) maybe all upstairs
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit though
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) two registers for that (pause_short) parlor room
(pause_medium) Adding two to that parlor room
maybe we should just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Or would you wanna do at least one of em
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I think we should do something
Only because (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Because if that (pause_short) remodel's a year away then
I I th (pause_medium)
I guess I th (pause_medium)
I think this thing is gonna be a cold little (pause_medium)
(pause_short) oh
I can def initely see that (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) See you only like (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the only heat you have in this room
is that (pause_short) one register over there
(pause_short) the windows in this thing are THUMP just a bout ready to fall out
I mean they're THUMP (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they're not (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Look at this
(pause_medium) So I know there's gonna be a lot of (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) A lotta infiltration
(pause_medium) See hopefully you'll go with double pane glass on your remodel
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) in some ways
(pause_short) is it a bad idea
Because you get a lot of natural (pause_short) heat from the the s from sun
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_short) Okay this is like it would get (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
The s in in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) until we kinda feel it out would be (uh)
(SNIFF) (pause_short) Sure
(pause_short) I mean this one it looks like
(pause_short) if we put a register over here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you wouldn't have to change it anyway
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) No that (pause_short) that (pause_medium)
that might (pause_short) work into it
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) And like I say
even i (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's not a big deal
(pause_medium) I mean somebody (pause_medium) just moves it
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) You might have to add a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there
but it's not a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) not a big deal
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Okay
Well let me check (pause_short) downstairs again
(pause_short) Well now you get (pause_medium)
you've got the logistics of every (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And then I think my wife
Now you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) now you say about (pause_medium)
(pause_short) my wife said she would like (pause_short) to have a register put in this room
(pause_medium) And I think it's kinda weird
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) what do you think
(pause_medium) Why would she (pause_medium)
What is this (pause_medium)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (uh) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) and we're gonna open this up
(pause_medium) This is sort of like a pantry
(pause_short) But it's gonna be (vocal_noises_inhalation) an extension of the kitchen
(pause_medium) Kind of
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know if (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
I'd (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
I'd put (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) About right there
WH I think WH (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Probably something's gonna go there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
(pause_medium) I
Cause that's about the only spot (pause_short) you can put it
I mean y we could put a (pause_medium)
we could put a floor r (pause_short) floor register right (pause_short) along here
(pause_medium) But that's probably where I'd put it
(pause_short) In fact the one that I was gonna put in there
I'd probably (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) let's (uh)
(pause_medium) Maybe on this end
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) It would have to be
(pause_medium) if anywhere
(pause_short) it'd have to be down
(pause_medium) okay
(pause_short) It's gonna help out
cause I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) See this whole area
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you've just got that one grill
(pause_medium) It's a pretty good sized area right here
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
Well let's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) let's consider that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) kitchen's got one right here
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_medium) I'm not too worried about the kitchen
(pause_medium) Cause I mean y (pause_medium)
and (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) VOX Ah we're in good shape that way (vocal_noises_exhalation) VOX
(pause_short) Wait a minute
(pause_short) Did I forget something else
(pause_medium) Ah yeah
(pause_medium) Because y
this (pause_short) this wall is eventually gonna come out
(pause_medium) And so (uh)
(pause_short) Utility room
(pause_medium) utility room
(pause_medium) And we're moving the utility room
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) and this
T (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) This is a joke
(pause_short) N_look at this
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (TSK)_Well some of these
to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Like (pause_medium)
I'm th I'm I'm wa I'm beginning to won der if (pause_medium)
Because what I would prob (pause_medium)
(pause_short) What you can do
(pause_medium) (uh)
Cause the furnace is (pause_medium) somewhere in that general area
(pause_medium) It's right there
(pause_medium) And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct
(pause_medium) and bring it to this room
Well that's what we wan ted to (pause_medium)
that's what we wanna kn (pause_short) wanna know
(pause_short) Alright
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But maybe t (pause_medium)
That can be done at (pause_short) at any time
you should (pause_medium) say
this is what it's gonna cost you to put in (pause_medium) a duct here
(pause_medium) all these ducts
(pause_medium) at this time
Now I don't know if (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if we can price em out individually
(pause_short) Sure
utility r (pause_short) utility room
(pause_short) Just pu (uh) (pause_short) call it a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Utility room kitchen
(pause_medium) that back one we'll call that (pause_medium) pantry
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Pantry
(pause_medium) and then you got the dining room glass
(pause_medium) dining room
(pause_medium) and then the (pause_short) parlor
(pause_medium) one on each end there
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Cause we can do em now
(pause_medium) But it's not (pause_medium) any more difficult (pause_medium) to do em (pause_short) at a later time
(pause_medium) So it's not like you have to do it now
(pause_medium) So the registers that we're connecting to
(pause_medium) and then we've got (uh)
one in the d (pause_short) living room here
(pause_medium) That guy
(pause_medium) then there's one in the bathroom
there's one in the s (pause_medium) study
(pause_medium) and there is one in the (pause_short) library
(pause_short) Or in the parlor
(pause_medium) I don't know what we'd do with that
(pause_medium) Do we disconnect that
(pause_medium) or do you leave it
(pause_short) Uh
(pause_short) yeah I might disconnect that
(pause_medium) Well it's not (pause_short) it's not connected up right now
(pause_medium) Oh that's right
(pause_medium) so it'd just be a matter w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Actually it sh (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it should be capped off probably though
(pause_medium) And this is the study
(pause_medium) one right there
(pause_medium) and the bathroom's got one
(pause_short) Bathroom's got one
(pause_medium) On the floor
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) okay
(pause_medium) at that furnace
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) This morning we're gonna be looking in the book of Exodus
(pause_medium) And we've been talking about (uh) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Vision
(pause_medium) And hearing from God
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I was trying to come up with a definition
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) there is definitely a definition
(pause_short) several
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) (TSK) (pause_short) so I thought I'd try to come up with one of my own
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) Jim Larson was (uh) sharing a quote
(pause_medium) from Yogi Bara
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He says you gotta be careful when you don't know where you're going
(pause_short) because you might not get there
(pause_medium) SM Which says so much
(pause_short) And vision
(vocal_noises_inhalation) having an idea of where you're going
(pause_medium) Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Our vision
(pause_medium) and here's the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you can write this down
but (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) don't use it unless you
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) agree with it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's mentally seeing
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) in a specific period of time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's in your imagination
in your (pause_medium) hopes (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) that you're looking ahead
(pause_medium) And h (pause_medium) trying to see where you will be
(pause_short) in a specific period period of time
(pause_short) So our vision for the next few years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) the (pause_medium) (TSK) next ten years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) As a church planter
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) having grown up here
and having gone off to (pause_short) to school
(pause_medium) to seminary
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) God brought him back
(pause_medium) And he began to seek God's (pause_short) (uh) vision
(pause_short) for (pause_short) the church
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And through his own personal experience
and through (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) the Scripture
(pause_medium) (TSK) and God gave him a vision
(pause_medium) for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) a church that was
(pause_medium) invested in building the Kingdom of God
(pause_medium) By caring for people where their needs were
(pause_medium) and by sharing the truth
(pause_medium) of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) Our vision is
(pause_short) is a direction of involvement toward a final destination
(pause_medium) When I started thinking about missions
I (pause_short) thought immediately of (pause_medium) the Blues Brothers
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) comes out
(pause_short) Q we're on a mission from God Q
(pause_medium) SM And that's what the church is about
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In fact
(pause_medium) The church has been given a mission
(pause_medium) but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) our mission is to participate in
an to carry out (pause_medium) God's mission
(pause_short) Because you see God
(pause_medium) is on a mission
(pause_medium) God's mission is to build His Kingdom
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love (vocal_noises_inhalation) relationship
(pause_medium) with him
(pause_medium) Through faith
(pause_medium) You know what
(pause_medium) does not include reaching lost people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then it's not God's vision
(pause_medium) God loves (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) people who don't have it all together
(pause_medium) God loves people who are hurting
(pause_medium) God loves people who are suffering
(pause_medium) And if our vision
(pause_short) In fact
if our vision as individual (pause_short) Christians
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) reaching out
(pause_medium) the lives of lost hurting (pause_short) dying people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC it's not a vision from God MRC
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because God's plan
(pause_short) is
(pause_short) and has always been
to use (pause_short) his people
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) to carry out His mission
(pause_medium) And we're gonna see that
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Beginning in the first chapter of Moses
I'm not gonna read (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I am gonna read some of it
(pause_medium) because we're gonna try to
(pause_short) breeze through the first four chapters
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's look how God was involved in Moses
(pause_medium) Or how God involved Moses in His mission
(pause_medium) Gary
(pause_medium) (uh)
is build a taller (pause_medium) podium
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) We (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) Oops
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) First thing we're gonna see
(pause_short) is that MRC God prepares His servants for mission
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) God (pause_short) prepares (pause_short) his servants (pause_short) for mission MRC
(pause_medium) As we read in (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) actually as we get to the second chapter
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) but he was prepared
(pause_medium) Uh for his part in (pause_short) God's mission
(pause_short) We have to go to chapter one to get a little background
(pause_medium) Read with me in verse six of chapter one
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) READ Now Joseph and all his brothers
(pause_short) and all that generation died
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But the Israelites were fruitful
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so that the land was filled with them
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then a new king
(pause_medium) who did not know about Joseph
(pause_medium) Look
(pause_short) he said to his people
(pause_short) the Israelites have become (pause_short) much too numerous (pause_short) for us
(pause_medium) Come
for (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or they will become even more numerous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and if war breaks out
(pause_short) will join our enemies
(pause_medium) fight against us
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So they put the slave masters over them
to oppress them and f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) with forced (pause_short) labor
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they built (pause_medium) Python
(pause_medium) and Ramses
(pause_medium) As store cities
(pause_medium) For Pharaoh
(pause_medium) But the more they were oppressed
(pause_short) So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They made their lives bitter
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And with all kinds of work in the fields
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) In all their hard labor
(pause_short) ruthlessly READ
(pause_medium) The king
(pause_medium) was a little upset
(pause_medium) the Israelites
(pause_short) who were their servants
(pause_medium) As they took a census
(pause_short) they realized
that the Israelites' (pause_medium) numbers
(pause_medium) were catching up
(pause_medium) With their own
(pause_short) Of the Egyptians
(pause_short) And this was upsetting
because he saw this as a (pause_short) national threat
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) From his perspective
they w (pause_medium)
(pause_short) they r (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
he just (vocal_noises_inhalation) knew that they were gonna grow to a number
(pause_short) You know
if any (vocal_noises_inhalation) other countries decided to attack
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) to (pause_short) to battle
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) the Egyptians
and were gonna (pause_short) overthrow from the inside
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) So the next part of the chapter
he begins to (vocal_noises_exhalation)
first of all he b (pause_medium)
he (pause_short) works the men very hard
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) having babies
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) work em
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) and (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But that didn't work
Cause they st (pause_medium)
They continued to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They Continued (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They continued to d (pause_medium)
to (uh)
(pause_short) have babies
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) So he g devises another plan
(pause_short) He goes to the midwives
(pause_medium) You know the Israelites had midwives
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) who when a
when (pause_medium) one of the Israelite women were gonna have a baby
and help (pause_short) in the labor process
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Or in the birthing process
(pause_medium) And so he goes to the midwives and says
(pause_short) listen
(pause_medium) you go
(pause_short) and you help these (pause_short) these mothers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but if they have a boy
(pause_medium) I want you to make sure that
(pause_short) that boy dies
(pause_medium) If it's a girl
(pause_medium) And that was his plan
(pause_medium) Well the midwives
(pause_medium) you know
this is the (pause_short) the Pharaoh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so they agreed to it
(pause_medium) Because they feared God
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And when (uh) he calls em
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) There's still boys being born here
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) what is going on
(pause_medium) The midwives said
(pause_short) well these
(pause_short) these mothers
(pause_medium) they're having the babies without us
(pause_short) You know
They're s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) sturdy women
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_short) they don't need us
(pause_short) And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan
It ends up in the (pause_medium) final verse of this chapter
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Verse twenty two
must be (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you must throw into the Nile
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But let every girl live READ
(pause_medium) So he's ordering his people to go
(pause_short) And every boy that is born to the Israelites
(pause_medium) to (pause_short) to kill em
(pause_medium) Well Moses was born about this time
(pause_medium) And this is how God preserved (pause_medium) Moses
(pause_medium) Now Moses's mother (pause_medium) loved her child
(pause_medium) And she didn't want to throw him in
(pause_medium) And she wasn't gonna do it herself
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and she was one of these that had the baby
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And Moses already
(pause_medium) when he was born
(pause_short) had an older sister and an older brother
(pause_medium) And the mother
(pause_short) now when I was growing up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was hiding the baby in the reeds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) didn't say anything about the (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) the (pause_medium)
in the (uh) (pause_short) basket
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) she j (pause_medium)
she (pause_short) was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and so she devised a plan
(pause_short) And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) but
(pause_medium) This mother knew what she was doing
(pause_medium) She b (pause_short) she m (pause_short) got a basket
(pause_medium) She (pause_short) perhaps made the basket
(pause_medium) Probably did
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then she put
(pause_medium) what they call pitch
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
so that it (pause_short) would float
(pause_medium) So that water wouldn't come up through it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she put (pause_short) a blanket
(pause_short) put the baby in it
(pause_medium) wrapped the baby in it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she told (pause_medium)
(pause_short) she brought it down to the river
(pause_short) Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She brought it to a specific place
(pause_short) Not just because there were reeds there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but because
(pause_short) the Pharaoh's daughter bathed (pause_short) there
(pause_medium) And this was a selected place
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The mother took the baby
(vocal_noises_inhalation) put the baby
put Moses (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in the water
(pause_medium) And told her sister to keep an eye on it
(pause_medium) To keep an eye on him so that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) nothing bad happened
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but also
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So the w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The Pharaoh's daughter came down to (pause_medium)
to take her bath (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And she sees the basket
(pause_short) And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she opens it up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_short) Pharaoh's daughter felt sorry for Moses
(pause_medium) And she just decided to keep him
(pause_medium) It said
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Aw aw
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And so she
(pause_short) she decides to keep him
(pause_short) Well
(pause_medium) Here's what (pause_short) pha (pause_medium)
(uh)
(pause_medium) That was her cue
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She comes out from hiding
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Oh
(pause_medium) whatever your name is
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) oh
(pause_medium) Allow me
(pause_short) to get a nurse for (pause_short) the baby
(pause_medium) I know of an Israelite nurse
that can take care (pause_medium) of this baby
(pause_medium) Guess who
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) SM Her mother SM
(pause_medium) So she goes and gets (pause_short) the mother
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_medium) Why do I think this is something that (pause_medium) the mother knew about
(pause_medium) Cause it ends up that
(pause_short) the mother
(pause_short) not only
(pause_medium) had her child
(pause_medium) to stay alive
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But she also
(pause_medium) got to take care of him
(pause_medium) and got paid for it
(pause_short) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_short) So God not only spared his life
(pause_short) (uh)
for (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) for that whole family
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But especially for Moses
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So we see how
(pause_medium) God preserved
(pause_medium) Moses
(pause_medium) We also see how God (pause_short) prepared Moses
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) because in the (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Moses's life is kinda divided into three (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) stages
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The second forty years he was (pause_short) a shepherd
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And the third forty years he was leading the people out of Israel
(pause_medium) And in this first forty years
(pause_medium) Moses (pause_short) got the best training
(pause_medium) in the world at that time
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) His foundational training came from his mother
(pause_medium) Cause as the nanny
(pause_medium) and that's what she was at that point
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) She (pause_short) trained him (pause_medium) in the foundations
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) taught him about his Hebrew origin
(pause_medium) and the customs of the Israel (pause_medium) Israelites
(pause_medium) Taught him the foundational belief (pause_medium) in (pause_short) the true God
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) taught him of God's promise to Abraham
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to multiply (pause_short) his descendants
(pause_short) and make a (pause_short) mighty nation
(pause_medium) of them
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Probably the first four or five years
(pause_medium) the bulk of his time was spent with his mother
(pause_medium) And he
(pause_medium) I'm sure she told him that
(pause_medium) that (uh)
(pause_medium) and and about what had happened
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) if (pause_short) she didn't
(pause_medium) But not only did he get this religious training
(pause_medium) (TSK) and this foundational (pause_short) belief (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in a r in a real God
(pause_medium) but he also
(pause_short) Exposed to the wisest teachers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he learned about the politics and customs (pause_medium) of the courts
(pause_medium) of course this would help him later on
(pause_short) when he had to come back and
(pause_short) and (uh)
(pause_short) and deal with the courts from (pause_short) a different perspective
(pause_medium) but that first forty years was spent (pause_short) in being trained
(pause_medium) And he was trained well
(pause_medium) And he had great knowledge
(pause_medium) A lot of knowledge
(pause_medium) That he was (uh)
(pause_medium) that (pause_short) God provided for him
through these (pause_medium) means
(pause_medium) And then for the next forty years
(pause_medium) From Egypt
(pause_medium) Because
in order to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) thinking
(pause_medium) that because he was an Israelite
(pause_medium) by birth
(pause_medium) (uh)
and seeing (pause_medium) an Israeli being (pause_short) abused
(pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he buried him
(pause_medium) and then a few days later
thinking well it's (pause_short) it's all cool
(pause_short) nobody knows
I'll just (pause_short) go on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He tries to help
(pause_medium) or tries to intervene between two other
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) Hebrew
(pause_medium) that were arguing amongst themself and
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) he tries to be a peacemaker
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_medium) w what about this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) And he realized if these (pause_medium)
(pause_short) if these men knew
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He ran
(pause_medium) He went out into the wilderness
(pause_medium) After a few days of (pause_short) (uh) walking
he (pause_medium) comes upon a a scene
where these two young ladies are herding (pause_medium) their father's sheep
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) mean guys
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who knows
I don't (pause_short) remember who it was
(pause_short) to (uh)
(pause_medium) take advantage of the (pause_short) two ladies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep
(pause_short) either way
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) Moses intervened
(pause_medium) And saved their lives
and saved (pause_short) their (pause_short) livestock
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so they invited him to come with them
to (pause_short) to their home
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Moses ends up marrying
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) one of the young ladies
(pause_short) As Ken (pause_medium) shared with us the other day
it was a (pause_short) a mixed marriage
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) this family was Black
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) So for the next (pause_short) forty years
(pause_medium) he becomes a sheep herder
(pause_medium) Who was a (pause_short) a Midian priest
(pause_medium) And during that forty years
(pause_short) First of all he became an outdoorsman
He became used to being out (pause_short) in the wilderness
(pause_medium) And that's gonna be important for him
for his (pause_medium) final forty years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Another thing he's
(pause_short) the area where he herded the sheep
was a (pause_short) a huge (pause_medium) area
(pause_medium) And (uh) he got to know the terrain
(pause_short) And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in that same area
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the w (pause_short) waterholes were and
and where the dangerous (pause_short) areas were
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) and so God (pause_short) prepared him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) God also has (pause_short) prepared us
(pause_medium) for h (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in God's mission
(pause_medium) God is continually (pause_short) building character
(pause_medium) this (pause_short) middle forty years for Moses
(pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) He had to (vocal_noises_inhalation) learn how to depend on God
(pause_medium) ON this God that he had learned about
(pause_medium) From his mother
(pause_medium) And God is interested in building character in us
(pause_short) as individuals
(pause_medium) In fact
God is more concerned about (pause_short) our character
(pause_medium) And how we do it
(pause_medium) And so a lot of what we experience
(pause_short) but God's (pause_medium) purpose (pause_short) is to build character within us
(pause_medium) And so when we're trying to decide w which we should do or not do
(pause_short) something that we're tempted to do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we need to remember that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and we should (pause_short) be obedient to Him
because that's how He builds (pause_short) our character
(pause_medium) I believe that God has created
(pause_short) and preserved
(pause_short) and prepared Uptown Baptist Church
(pause_medium) To be involved in His mission
(pause_medium) To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting
(pause_medium) To be an influence
(pause_medium) to the community of Uptown
(pause_medium) for the Kingdom of God
(pause_medium) To be a beacon of light
(pause_medium) for those who are lost
(pause_medium) and as our sign says on top
(pause_short) to proclaim that (pause_medium) Christ died for our sins
(pause_medium) God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church
(pause_medium) to be a model for urban (pause_short) church (pause_short) missions to the world
(pause_medium) And that wasn't (pause_short) our reasoning
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) or so that we could (pause_medium) get (pause_medium) publicity
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But God has saw seen fit to use us in that way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And this is not for our pride
(pause_medium) this is just (pause_medium) a reality
(pause_medium) I'm amazed at how (pause_medium) people from all over the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to the city
(pause_medium) or they read a book
(pause_short) (uh) that talked about Uptown Baptist Church
(pause_medium) God has crea (pause_medium)
also (pause_short) created an prepared you and me
(pause_medium) to be involved in His plan
(pause_medium) First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him
(pause_medium) Some of us have accepted that call
(pause_medium) and some (pause_short) are still struggling with it
(pause_medium) But still
(pause_medium) He wants to have a love (pause_short) relationship
(pause_short) with each person that is in this room
(pause_medium) He's brought us together from many backgrounds
(pause_short) many very different backgrounds
(pause_short) to be a family
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A family of followers (pause_medium) of Christ
(pause_medium) A family to be involved (pause_short) in God's mission
(pause_medium) Building the Kingdom of God
(pause_medium) I was talking to Greg on Friday
(pause_medium) and he was sharing wi (pause_medium)
he (pause_medium) he really needed (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) intellectual stimulation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and we were talking about why
(pause_medium) And God just (pause_medium) flashed in my mind
(pause_short) You know God
(pause_medium) created you to be intellectual
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because God didn't create us for our purpose
(pause_short) God created (pause_short) us for His purpose
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's something we have to keep
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) before us
(pause_short) God has created us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) For his purpose
(pause_medium) And it's for us to seek Him
(pause_medium) Papa Joe has been a
(pause_short) a very strong influence in this community
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Not because of his education
(pause_medium) his educations came from the streets
(pause_medium) And as he came to (pause_medium) a relationship with Jesus Christ
(pause_short) that w had survived
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) He was an alcoholic
(pause_medium) Now w how (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He wasn't educated
(pause_medium) he didn't go through special training
(pause_medium) it's because
(pause_medium) God prepared him
(pause_medium) with the experience of his life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so that he could reach out to other people who are (pause_short) going through the same experience
(pause_medium) So you can't say well I don't have an education
Or I don't (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You have to know that whatever (pause_short) God has given you
Whatever (vocal_noises_inhalation) experience that God has brought you through
(pause_short) That He wants to use it
(pause_medium) To reach people
(pause_medium) for His Kingdom
(pause_medium) The second thing I want us to know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) from this st (pause_short) story of Moses
is that God reveals His mission (pause_medium) to His servants
(pause_medium) The first that God prepares His servants for His mission
(pause_medium) the second is that God reveals His mission (pause_medium) to His servants
(pause_medium) We have to go to Exodus three
(pause_medium) and see how God gets Moses's attention
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Apricot mustard sauce
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Liver and onions

(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) She was in the hospital three times
With (pause_medium) asth matic bronchitis
With bron (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And so
(pause_medium) Well
I (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
For some reason (pause_medium)
because she was so worried about (vocal_noises_inhalation) Jonathan
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) like oh
And then she (pause_short) told her that
(pause_short) She did n't have what
We'are all going (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Barb didn't outgrow it

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe she's (pause_medium)
Alw (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe she's addicted
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) a semi hypochondriac
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe there's coke in it
I think that that's (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) closer to the truth (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I think you're righ t
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (COUGH) (COUGH) (COUGH)
I always ha ve (pause_medium)
(pause_short) get backaches
(pause_medium) I think I get backaches because
(pause_medium) I mean some people's bodies are built a (pause_medium) certain way
(pause_medium) just don't take care of it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and be cause
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short)(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the world is built for women who are about five five
It's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And it's (pause_medium)
And bec ause you're (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The bo dy is not
(pause_short) It's cause of the way my body is
the human body (pause_medium)
Because y (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The human bod (pause_short) backbone
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) for (pause_short) an animal (pause_medium) to walk on two f eet
(pause_short) So if you were (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
That's (pause_medium) basic ally
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Actually
(pause_short) Really
(pause_short) Is to (pause_short) get down on your hands and knees
and walk arou (pause_medium)
not crou (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Not (pause_short) all the way down though
(pause_short) H unh
(pause_medium) It hurt
(pause_short) but then your back's (pause_short) gets sway back
(pause_medium) (TSK) N but
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) th (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
No if you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) If you just s tand there it will
you know (um) (Hx)
you keep it (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) when I
(pause_short) I asked
(pause_short) when (pause_short) I went in with my (pause_short) arm
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) cause I had tr so much trouble with my elbow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And
(pause_short) so
(pause_short) while (pause_short) she was (pause_short) giving me the (pause_short) treatment one time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she said the l (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The newest theory is the opposite
We (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They used to say
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that you lie flat
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
with your e (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
So that (pause_short) it will (pause_short) curve this way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) So that it curves this way
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) She says now we're having em do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh) exercises
(pause_short) Arching
(pause_short) and you lift your shoulders up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then you keep doing it
until you can have your hands (pause_short) totally straight
and your hips on the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean your arms totally straight
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I started doing that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that
(pause_medium) But I can't (pause_medium)
and he (pause_short) couldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He was walking stooped over
his back (pause_medium) hurt so bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You have to (pause_medium)
You star t out real (pause_medium)
(pause_short) We put (pause_short) four pillows under his knees
(H)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But you see
(pause_medium) Hm
then that's what you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) different people have different ty (pause_short) kinds
Well and it was probably just from (pause_medium) being sick
That (pause_medium) caused it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (TSK) I am conc (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Carolyn thinks she's got a kid ney infection
(pause_medium) P (vocal_noises_laughter) Oh my (pause_short) God (vocal_noises_laughter) P (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
Carolyn's al (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Carolyn's almost as bad as Barb
(pause_short) but
(pause_medium) She just has these little things that come every once in a while and they're always serious
(H) Well she's got (pause_short) a pain
at (pause_short) at her waist
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and she's not
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) going to the bathroom as often as she should
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) She's gonna get fat
(vocal_noises_laughter) Water bloating
she's gonna get bloated (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's different than fat
(pause_medium) WH No it isn't the same thing WH
(pause_medium) Looks like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh I know
once it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) looked at her and thought it was just a muscle spasm
(pause_short) So they gave her some (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) He or she got a (pause_medium) some pills for muscle spasms
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Because they told Marleen
(pause_short) Well
the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) Yeah that's what we always thought too
(pause_short) yeah that's what we thought
(pause_short) where (pause_medium)

(vocal_noises_inhalation)
They told her they were (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
(pause_medium) here
(pause_medium) That's weird
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) Hm
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I think (vocal_noises_exhalation)

It's just mo ving (pause_short) through her system
But they did n't even do a urinalysis (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Which I think is ridiculous

But will a urine sh ow (pause_short) kidneys

The first week he (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (H) He had a vi (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)

(pause_short) That we could address fairly (pause_short) easily (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
I was thinking we should walk down sometime to h (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) to the (umm)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_exhalation) eeya eeya eeya

(pause_medium) Scott
(pause_short) I used the rest of the orange juice
but I put (pause_short) the container back
(pause_medium) in the fridge
(pause_medium) So that we don't have to wash it
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) So far
(pause_medium) How much is it
(pause_medium) It's like six dollars a month
(pause_medium) (TSK) That's okay
(pause_medium) (COUGH) (COUGH)
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) it's cute there
(pause_short) but if you're gonna sit there and read
(pause_medium) Well would it work to put it on the other end
(pause_medium) It wouldn't be as (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) P Right P
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_medium) That radiator tilts
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_medium) (HUMMING)
(pause_medium) So I got to look at the cop y
(pause_short) of (umm)
(pause_medium) it's Dante's (pause_short) Inferno
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_medium) It's a new translation
(pause_short) with twenty different (pause_medium) contemporary American poets
(pause_medium) Got different cantos
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) And so it's neat
(pause_short) Cause there's these poets that (pause_short) I like
(pause_medium) And they've done translations
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Of these different (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) whatever toes
(pause_medium) And (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) they
(pause_medium) well it's expensive
(pause_medium) And it's nice
(pause_medium) And it matches kind of this
(pause_medium) bath book
(pause_short) Mhm
And I wasn't pla (pause_medium)
I don't really (pause_short) need it
(pause_medium) the Divine (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I wasn't urgently planning on getting the Divine Comed (pause_medium)
The (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) Those two books together
(pause_medium) So I was thinking it's sort of an aesthetic thing
(pause_medium) That it would be nice to get them together
(pause_medium) At a time
(pause_medium) I'm gonna have a little vacation
And then I could (pause_short) read
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) I do realize it's a little bit (pause_medium) (TSK) far out
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) it seems like there's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the Alexandra Stoddard book back
(pause_medium) Uh (uh)
They re turned (pause_medium)
I think they returned the one (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The one that I had that had the
(pause_medium) the blue and red writing

(pause_medium) Maybe it mean s that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Maybe the paperback's going out

(pause_medium) (TSK) I can always order another one if I need to
(pause_short) (WHISTLING)
(pause_short) Hm

(pause_medium) Which one
(pause_medium) The one that just looks kinda decrepit
(pause_medium) That one
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Maybe we could (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) would probably do better
(pause_medium) I think we thought about doing that in the springtime
(pause_medium) then I thought we'd replant them
(pause_medium) Yeah
but I think there's more babies than (pause_medium) we need
Would (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) And we've got three new babies that I could replant
(pause_medium) already
(pause_short) And that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) has lots of babies
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Oh

(pause_medium) That interest you at all
(pause_medium) Unhunh
(pause_medium) Cause if it (pause_medium)
I thi (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I think it probably would
(pause_medium) It seemed like it would be fun to read out loud
(pause_medium) And I don't wanna start it if we're going to read it together
I wonder if (pause_short) if it would be
(pause_medium) any less (pause_short) abstract (pause_medium) than the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah there's a lot mo re conversa (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Like the part where she falls on the ground
Could be (pause_short) easier to follow
(pause_short) and says
(pause_short) VOX I am nature's bride VOX
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) she also says several other things
And there's also (pause_short) commentary (pause_short) from the narrator
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_medium) gets the point across
(pause_short) Simply
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) yeah

(pause_medium) listed
(pause_short) But they are clip art books
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) One is for VOX feasts and celebrations VOX
And one is for something (pause_medium)
They have neat (pause_short) titles
(pause_medium) You just need to get yourself a clip art book and a scanner
(pause_medium) And a scanner
(pause_short) And then you'd like load em (pause_short) into your computer and make your things with them
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) See then you could
make (pause_medium) them different colors

they stuck it in a tu (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) around his face
so that he could (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) but they put a mist in it

(vocal_noises_inhalation) thing on his finger
(pause_medium) It's like light sensored
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And they have to guard it from the light
(pause_short) And it measures (pause_short) his oxygen (pause_short) percent
(pause_short) Cool
(pause_short) It was weird
And he was all in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Which (pause_medium)

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he'd just do
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) he was doing it

(pause_short) to put the masa
(pause_medium) And that's the one that takes a lot of time
(pause_medium) Oops
(pause_medium) WH (WHISTLING) WH
(pause_medium) So (uh)
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay folks
(pause_medium) We got on the elevator right here
(pause_short) came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) down that stairway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then right at that yellow line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you're now standing over the second largest water pipe in the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it's called a penstock
(pause_medium) More about that a little bit later
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The Colorado River
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In order to build a dam here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was to get rid of that river
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So they came up here above where the dam was to be built
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and drilled and blasted out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Two on either side
(vocal_noises_inhalation) into the canyon wall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) out in the river down below
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty six feet in diameter
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then lined with three feet of concrete
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They then came up here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to force this river into these diversion tunnels
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Came back down here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) about sixty five feet high
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to keep this water from backing into the work area
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They now had from here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to here where they could build a dam
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They pumped the water out of this area
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and excavated down another hundred and thirty five feet to bedrock
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay folks
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) looks like a series of boxes or blocks
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and those are wooden concrete forms
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but they did vary in area somewhat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because they did not build the dam right straight across the river
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from canyon wall to canyon wall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they built it in the form of an arc
(pause_medium) And it's called an arch (pause_short) gravity design dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Where the force of the water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wall
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's a very strong design
(pause_medium) They did build two concrete mixing plants here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they did pour concrete for twenty four hours a day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) three hundred and sixty five days a year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For two years
(pause_short) less (pause_medium) six days
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight cubic yard bucketloads
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the smallest of which is twenty two by twenty five feet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) only filled that form up about three or four inches deep
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So there goes that story you may have heard
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that there are workers buried in the concrete here
(pause_short) Couldn't possibly happen
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was one inch steel water pipe
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They came down here in this lower cofferdam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they built an ice plant
(pause_short) Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They used that ice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) As concrete hardens
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it produces heat
(pause_medium) The more you can control that heat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the better job of curing you're going to get
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So they used the chilled water method
(vocal_noises_inhalation) forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete
(vocal_noises_inhalation) picking up some of that heat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then carrying that heat out and away
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They felt if they did not use a method such as this
(pause_short) that it would've taken approximately (vocal_noises_inhalation) one hundred and fifty years
for the concrete (pause_short) in the interior part of the dam (vocal_noises_inhalation) to cool down
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So the system did work
(pause_medium) And then it hardened
(pause_short) they left voids
(vocal_noises_inhalation) those voids were filled with grout
(pause_medium) Grout being a mixture of concrete and water
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When this is done
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or basically a solid block of concrete
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base
(vocal_noises_inhalation) fourty five feet across the top
(vocal_noises_inhalation) twelve hundred and fourty four feet from wingtip to wingtip
(vocal_noises_inhalation) seven hundred and twenty six point four feet high
(pause_medium) MRC Six point six million tons of concrete MRC
(pause_medium) That's enough concrete to build a two lane highway (vocal_noises_inhalation) from New York City to San Francisco
(pause_medium) Or
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a four foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways
(vocal_noises_inhalation) As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Here they are
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What they did
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) closed these gates up here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) now this yellow part is forever under water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Underneath that lake out there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But they did incorporate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the balance of those diversion tunnels
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) using these outer two as spillway tunnels
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now these spillways were built
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is twenty seven feet lower than the top of the dam
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) This assures us that n any excess water coming down the Colorado River
(vocal_noises_inhalation) rather than overtopping the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) overtops these spillways on either side
(vocal_noises_inhalation) goes into the canyon wall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) out in the river down below
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Each one of these spillways is capable of handling (vocal_noises_inhalation) two hundred thousand cubic feet per second of water
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Falls three times higher than Niagara Falls does
(vocal_noises_inhalation) time that water reaches this area down in here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it is flowing at between one hundred
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and one hundred and twenty miles an hour
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay we have protected the spillways
(vocal_noises_inhalation) now they had to get some water
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) into the power plant
(pause_medium) What they did is they built four intake towers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Two on either side of the (vocal_noises_inhalation) river
(vocal_noises_inhalation) each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake
(pause_medium) are three hundred and ninety five feet high
(pause_medium) Each with two eleven by thirty two foot gates in them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) one gate near the bottom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to let the water in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The water then coming into the penstocks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like the one we're standing over right now
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) This penstock
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is three stories high
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Made in section twenty two feet long
(pause_short) Each section weighing approximately (vocal_noises_inhalation) a hundred and fifty tons
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Each of these twenty two foot sections is joined to the next section
(vocal_noises_inhalation) using pressure pins like this
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) approximately two hundred and thirty four pounds per square inch
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay we have the water this far
(vocal_noises_inhalation) each one of em going to a turbine
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The force of the water turns the turbine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and generates power
(pause_medium) The water then coming on the tailrace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and going on downstream to be used at least (pause_short) six more times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to generate more power
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Good clean (pause_short) reusable non polluting source of energy
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The cost of the project
(pause_medium) A hundred and seventy five million dollars
(pause_medium) I say project
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and in southern California they built the All American Canal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which takes water to the people and the crops
(pause_short) of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This money was borrowed on a fifty year term at three percent interest
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and was paid off in full in nineteen eighty seven
(pause_medium) The people who worked here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) average twenty four hour work force was about thirty five hundred men
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete
(vocal_noises_inhalation) fourty three hundred men
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator
(vocal_noises_inhalation) at a dollar and a quarter an hour
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Out of each man's paycheck
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a dollar and sixty cents
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because the contractor was feeding
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and housing the men in Boulder City
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and taking them back and forth out here to the job site
(pause_medium) They did have ninety six (pause_short) industrial deaths
(pause_short) The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Basically falling rock
(pause_medium) But they did have some killed by explosion
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some by drowning
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and other types of accidents you might expect to have
(vocal_noises_inhalation) On a job of this magnitude
(pause_medium) They did complete the project
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Started in early nineteen thirty one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) completed in late nineteen thirty five
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Just twelve days short (pause_short) of five years
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Do I have any questions
(pause_medium) What's this overhead pipe here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The overhead pipe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's the fresh air pipe
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) In the summertime
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So they bring that fresh air in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the water in that sump is a constant fifty three degrees
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It cools that air down to between sixty eight and seventy two degrees
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then they force it back throughout the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So it's air conditioning without refrigeration
(pause_medium) Any other questions
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) Uh
during the (uh) (pause_medium) earthquake this morning
that (pause_short) measure any kind of movement
of (pause_medium) str uctur es
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_short) W v we have several things
(pause_short) First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We recorded those
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But we do have sensors
(vocal_noises_inhalation) any movement that concrete makes
(pause_short) is measured and recorded
(pause_medium) And they had very little of it this morning
(pause_medium) Any other questions
(pause_medium) How far are you sending electricity
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Fifty six percent of our power goes to southern California
(vocal_noises_inhalation) twenty five percent of it stays in Nevada
(vocal_noises_inhalation) nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona
(vocal_noises_inhalation) What the government did
(vocal_noises_inhalation) To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) California was growing very fast at that time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But by the same token
(vocal_noises_inhalation) at that time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No hotels
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we asked Las Vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they agreed to do that
(pause_medium) But that's all they get today
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because that contract is good through the year two thousand and seventeen
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So all those lights
(vocal_noises_inhalation) comes from power from steam plants
(vocal_noises_inhalation) owned and operated by Nevada Power Company
(vocal_noises_inhalation) using fossil fuel
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay folks
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Y yes it's a fantastic job they did down here
(pause_medium) Right now there's about two hundred
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That includes the security people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the people that (pause_short) run the computer room
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's a twenty four hour figure
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But that figure is becoming smaller every year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because every year we are becoming more highly computerized
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) F Okay folks
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Anybody needs the elevator it's available
(pause_medium) Come on
(pause_medium) Up the stairway if you can
(pause_short) P Up the stairway
That's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Up the stairs P
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) VOX Hi VOX
(pause_medium) That was the (pause_short) turbine over here
off to the side (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That's a (pause_medium) computer design made of stainless steel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's designed in such a way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there's one of em running at a hundred and eighty RPM
(pause_short) it actually lifts that eight hundred tons up a quarter of an inch
for your main thrust bearing is the very top of this (pause_short) uh structure right down here
(pause_medium) This is the rotor
(pause_medium) The rotor and the (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) runner
(pause_short) have come out of our A Seven generator
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So we had to pull those out to fix that water seal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they'll be replaced within a couple of weeks now
(pause_short) Oh I see
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That (vocal_noises_inhalation) rotor in that part of the shaft weighs five hundred and eighty tons
(pause_short) Hey
(pause_medium) How long have you been doing (pause_short) these tours
(pause_short) About five years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I've retired twice
(pause_medium) Anybody have any questions
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Ben
(pause_medium) water comes down the center of the
(pause_short) where your shaft is
(pause_short) goes out the turbine
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) goes around the dam
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) It comes into what they c (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the (pause_medium) area of the wicket gate
(pause_medium) and there (pause_medium)
And there's a (pause_short) pipe around that wicket gate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that pipe goes from a thirteen foot diameter
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It picks up speed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) By the time it enters that ap (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) goes out that aperture
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But that's what drives that big turbine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It goes around the shaft
(pause_medium) The wicket gate
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) All the water goes in through the wicket gate
(pause_medium) It's coming in (pause_short) underneath
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The wick (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Th (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) well
(H) and (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) yeah
(pause_short) The shaft is like this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then it goes ar ound like this
(uh)
with the (uh)
looked like a (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) that's a r turbine runner
(pause_short) kicked up on the side like that
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) it just (pause_short) lays (pause_short) it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh you mean the one d on the floor down there
And that's down inside the (uh)
(pause_short) in the turbine
That's way down (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) Okay folks
(pause_short) right on in
(pause_medium) step right in the elevator
(pause_medium) P Three
(pause_medium) nineteen
(pause_short) twenty P
(vocal_noises_inhalation) alright
(pause_medium) P Okay P
(pause_medium) Okay I saved room for you
(pause_short) All right
(pause_medium) Folks this does conclude your tour of the dam
(pause_medium) hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoying have you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Have any questions on the way up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) ask Norm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Bye bye folks
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) What's the (pause_short) story with this tile
(pause_medium) Wasn't this created by somebody
(pause_medium) Folks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the dam was built as a tourist attraction
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this terrazzo flooring you see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) ground down and polished
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this terrazzo flooring was put in here by one Italian family
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay there's two and three quarter acres of this (uh) (vocal_noises_inhalation) t (uh) terrazzo flooring in the floor
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but the designs you see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is what that Italian family saw (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and interpretated from (vocal_noises_inhalation) southwest Indian blankets and pottery
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Any other questions
(pause_medium) Are there just two elevators down
that'll take you to XX (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Two elevators down
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well there are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there are two miles of (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) tunnels going this way across the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They have a pipe gallery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they have a drainage gallery
they have a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) a (uh) (pause_medium) cable gallery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they have an instrumentation gallery
(pause_medium) And all those things are (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They (pause_short) measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery
(pause_medium) Y'all open seven days a week
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Is it unusual to
(pause_short) to do the generator (pause_short) (uh) (pause_medium) room (pause_short) floor
There's just (pause_medium)
It it's (pause_short) in fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they wanted to make it a tourist attra (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they wanted to make it very nice
(pause_medium) Usually you just have con crete deck s
I would (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Any other questions folks
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) What are the chances (pause_short) of a leak
(pause_medium) Hm
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it leaks all the time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You see concrete's porous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And because concrete's porous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But that's good
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because if there're no moisture in concrete
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it dries out
and (pause_short) spalls and chips
and (pause_short) turns to powder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Wouldn't make a very good dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So as long as that lake is back there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Green concrete's very strong
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So we have a good strong dam
(pause_medium) Say Ben
(pause_short) Yes
don't think it's (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That's a five story parking garage
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the new building is a new visitors center
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The five story parking garage will hold four hundred and fifty cars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
the new f (vocal_noises_inhalation) visitors center
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will have (pause_medium) three revolving theaters in it
(pause_medium) it'll have a (pause_short) seating area for people going on tour
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the top deck of that building will be an observation platform
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we can look back at the dam in one direction
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they hope to be able to figure
(pause_medium) to handle (pause_short) between one point two and one point three million people a year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Last year we had
(pause_short) seven hundred and twenty nine thousand eight hundred and eighty nine people go through the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but we had to turn people away
(pause_medium) Just not enough time in the day
(pause_short) Hmm
(pause_medium) Will it have any slot machines in it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Pay for this place
When's comple tion on that (pause_medium) parking garage
(pause_medium) They figure between fifteen and seventeen months
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Okay folks
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Right on in
(pause_medium) VOX Everyone please fa ce the front of the car VOX
(pause_medium) Seventeen more months
(pause_medium) VOX Everyone face the front of the car please VOX
(pause_medium) Right to there
(pause_medium) Have they ever had to use the spillway
(pause_medium) Okay folks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) come back and see us again
(vocal_noises_inhalation) ask Norm
(pause_short) Bye bye folks
(pause_medium) Have they ever had to use the spillway
(pause_short) Folks
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) What happened that year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and that was followed by rain and hot weather
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which created a flooding condition
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We had more water coming down the Colorado River system
(vocal_noises_inhalation) than they could put through the power plant
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) On July second
(pause_medium) water overtopped our spillways out here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Six days later
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that went on for sixty six days
(vocal_noises_inhalation) At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or to the power plant
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but no loss of life
(pause_medium) But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there
(pause_medium) That white line indicates it was going over the spillways
(vocal_noises_inhalation) four and a half feet above floodstage
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It gives a false impression
Or level the lake (pause_short) of the low
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Actually we're eight feet above normal
(pause_medium) Wow
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah we had a very good snowpack last year
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Um
(pause_medium) first of all
(pause_short) can tell me
(pause_medium) we talked a little bit about it
talk about (pause_short) the history of the penguins
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_medium) We have
(pause_short) on exhibit now
(pause_medium) Wow
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
That (pause_short) you have
((MIC_NOISE))
(pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Last year
(pause_medium) I s want to say around Christmas time
(pause_medium) we went down
as well as other (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) researchers and scientists
(pause_short) Mm
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I want to go into a little bit about
(pause_medium) the history of the Gentus here
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) for you (pause_medium)
For (pause_short) Don and Lori
where (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Where did our original Gentu penguins come from
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) Wasn't it
(pause_short) Where did the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) But
specifi cally (pause_medium)
From the (um)
(pause_short) was it (pause_medium) Edinburgh (uh) (pause_medium) Zoo
(pause_medium) Great
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) Okay
Are those the ones that (pause_medium) don't like people
(pause_medium) The hands off ones
(pause_medium) P H ands off one s P
That came from (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Where's Ten from
(pause_medium) There
Or is that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh okay
(pause_short) Well is (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Rockhoppers
(pause_short) The (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) Magella nics
Ra (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) which (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I take it you work mammals as well
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) so feel free to add in
(pause_short) when
(pause_medium) cause I've only worked like a weekend
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but both days were spent (pause_medium) with the penguins
Feeding the baby (pause_medium) penguins and then
(pause_medium) Ten and
(pause_medium) all of them
(pause_short) Great
(pause_short) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) feel free
after (pause_short) I've go through this information
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) usually the best way that we can get
(vocal_noises_inhalation) volunteers
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) in mammals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(pause_short) we got (pause_short) the penguins
(pause_short) from this (pause_short) zoo in Scotland
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_short) (TSK) you know
and they go into a quarantine (pause_medium) period
(pause_short) I do believe it was thirty days
(pause_medium) Don't (pause_short) don't
(pause_short) it's in my (pause_medium) literature right there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) there's a disease called n (pause_medium) Newcastle's Disease
is (pause_short) is very (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) contagious apparently
(pause_medium) and so there's always the potential
(pause_short) when you bring a bird over
(pause_short) contamidate (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_short) Business
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) (TSK) and so that is
(pause_short) th background (pause_short) information
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) with our (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) other penguins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) we brought them over
(pause_short) from Scotland
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) in a quarantine period that they had
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that (pause_medium) a vi (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) had come to (pause_short) fruition
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and we had lost
(pause_short) you know a good portion of penguins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) S o
now it's time to (pause_short) consider replacing these penguins
(pause_short) how do we want to go about doing that
(pause_short) Well
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) really didn't want to go
(pause_short) through
(pause_medium) Didn't work last time
(pause_short) a (pause_short) potential for bringing over diseases
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the thought was okay let's get some eggs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) Sea World San Diego (pause_medium) has Gentus
(pause_medium) apparently (pause_short) just not enough eggs to share
(pause_short) If they had them they would gladly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Same situation with the Edinburgh Zoo
(pause_medium) but
(pause_short) they didn't feel that they had enough eggs
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we really didn't want to go the bird route
and collecting some peng (pause_medium)
some penguin (pause_short) eggs ourselves
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) So they went to
(pause_medium) and I don't know if this is pronounced correctly
that's whe re (pause_medium) a lot of seals are from as well
(pause_medium) That'll fit in with your class
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Yeah (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Hi
Hey let me (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mine
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) Why don't you have a seat
(pause_medium) (SNORT)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) P Oh I'm tired P
they went to (pause_short) Wiencke Island
where (pause_short) a lot of seals are from
(pause_short) and
(vocal_noises_laughter)
X (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) the process was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the process was
(pause_short) was they
(um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) they went to the nest
(pause_short) okay from (pause_short) our staff
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) frankly I I'm not quite sure who the entourage of other people were
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they went to the nest
(pause_short) and basically
(pause_medium) waited for the penguin to stand up
(pause_medium) and checked to see if there were two eggs there
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_short) Gentu (pause_short) penguins
and this isn (pause_medium)
(pause_short) isn't true of all penguins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) when (pause_short) a (pause_medium) penguin lays eggs
one is (pause_short) smaller than the other
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Gentus lay two equally sized eggs
(pause_medium) (TSK) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) u m
(pause_short) the reason I mentioned that was
if one was (pause_short) smaller
(pause_medium) he would have went for the smaller egg
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Why
(pause_medium) Because that would probably mean (pause_short) that
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) Female
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) they lay two dif ferent sized eggs
(pause_medium) (TSK) Depending on the year
and depending on the conditions (pause_short) of light
(pause_medium) (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) environmental conditions are rough
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A penguin might (pause_short) lay two eggs
(pause_medium) P I don't P (pause_medium)
I don't really wanna use the word VOX decide VOX (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's kind of anthropomorphic
(pause_short) but
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) somehow figure out
(pause_medium) Q at this point I'm gonna kick out an egg Q
(pause_short) Ah
(pause_short) h owever it does determine to do so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) will kick out an egg
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Otherwise
(pause_short) it will (pause_short) brood the two eggs
(pause_short) and hatch em out
(pause_medium) (TSK) It's not uncommon that
(pause_medium) they'll kick out the smaller chick
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) If at that point conditions (pause_short) don't seem to be (vocal_noises_inhalation) sufficient to support raising two of em
(pause_medium) it's kind of like
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) one of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) One of the chicks
(pause_short) If it's a F great year
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
WH (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They'll (pause_short) they'll
(pause_short) they'll try to raise both
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) I didn't catch that
What wa (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(TSK) (pause_short) (H) WH Yeah WH
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) so
(pause_short) anyway
(pause_short) (TSK) (pause_medium) Apparently what th (pause_short) what they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Now at this point they wanted to see
is there actually a fertile (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Is there a fertile (pause_medium) chick
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) apparently it was very very muddy
it was (pause_short) abnormally warm
and they couldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) They couldn't (pause_short) clean off the mud enough
to (pause_short) be able to see inside
To see (pause_short) if
(pause_short) if it was viable
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they took an egg from nests
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I think this (pause_short) this report says
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) the eggs were back here in Chicago
(pause_medium) (TSK) Wow
(pause_short) (TSK) That's pret ty nea t
(pause_medium) And then
they (pause_short) took them to an L off site incubation area L
(pause_medium) in Addison
(pause_medium) I don't know where Addison is
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) I don't either s (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) West
(pause_medium) Yes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So they were out in the west suburbs
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(TSK) (pause_short) Mm
(pause_short) A nd
(pause_short) apparently now they're about
(pause_short) Wow
T (pause_medium) s two weeks ago it was six ty days
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Mm
(pause_medium) But when you see (pause_short) them
you'll see that they're (pause_medium) just about as big as number ten
(pause_medium) They're big
(pause_short) N kay
(pause_short) When I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they were (pause_short) losing all of their (pause_short) hair
(pause_medium) And they looked
(pause_medium) the two oldest ones looked like Ten
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So basically
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we brought them here as chicks
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) as they lost their downy feathers
they became eligible to go out (pause_short) onto exhibit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so what they did last time you guys were here
there was (pause_short) maybe (pause_medium) ten
(pause_short) That were
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) let them hang out for about a half an hour
(pause_medium) get acclimated to what was going on
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And do this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now they're out
(pause_medium) Now they're
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Almost all of em
(pause_medium) Two days ago there was twenty five out on exhibit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) thing of it is
is let's think a little bit about (pause_medium) penguin natural history
(pause_medium) How
(pause_short) how long do penguins (pause_short) spend on land
(pause_medium) Three months I think
(pause_medium) What's your guess
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) four
(pause_medium) Six
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So the sequence of events (pause_short) is
(pause_short) they come on (pause_short) to shore
(pause_medium) springtime
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they hook up with their mate
(pause_short) they build a nest
(pause_short) they mate
(pause_short) they lay their eggs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they brood their eggs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) they molt
(pause_medium) and then they're out to sea
(pause_medium) So all of that has to happen
(pause_short) within that six month period
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's a pretty busy bird
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) WH (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
in order to be (pause_short) ready
really need to be (pause_medium) very well suited for that
(THROAT)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they need to have their adult feathers
(pause_medium) so
(pause_medium) between the time that they actually hatch out
(pause_medium) and the time that they're ready to go out to sea
(pause_short) How long does it take for them (pause_short) to hatch
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well the incubation peri od
Or (um)
(pause_short) to have experience
it's (pause_short) it's one month to two months
(pause_medium) (TSK) Okay
(pause_medium) you know basically
(pause_medium) between (pause_medium) building a nest
(pause_medium) to (pause_short) to grow and get ready
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) So they're big
(pause_short) Now the funny thing is
(pause_short) according to Mark Ryan
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX well VOX
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
I guess (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(um)
they (pause_short) walk into the exhibit
and they (vocal_noises_inhalation) start throwing penguins into the water
(pause_medium) And pushing them in
and they're (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) all over the place
(um)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) they try to get out
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Gentus usually dive in (pause_medium) head first
(pause_medium) these guys are falling in
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
so their (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) behaviors if you will are
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) they're doing something different with these chicks than we've done with the other penguins
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) yesterday I think is th is th is when they tried it for the first time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that crill
(pause_short) Mhm
you know from (pause_short) my joint
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so (pause_short) it's very difficult for a person to hold a crill
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) and drop it into a penguin's mouth
(pause_short) very good f s food source for them
(pause_short) in addition to other things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(pause_short) they're throwing the crill into the water
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So they tried it yesterday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) y a apparently they they'll keep doing this
(pause_short) So
(pause_short) Did (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When they were chicks
cause what is it (pause_medium)
How does a mother (vocal_noises_inhalation) feed (pause_medium) a penguin chick
(pause_medium) Doesn't she bring food to it
(pause_short) She regurgitates it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But yeah
(pause_medium) and they regurgitate up the food
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Actually other birds do that as well
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
they started them off with (um) (pause_short) strips of fish
and they actually (pause_short) dipped it in a vitamin and um (pause_medium) (TSK) pureed crill batter
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
and then gave it (pause_short) to the penguin chicks
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_short) for quite some time
(pause_medium) and now it's just interesting to see if they'll just go for the crill itself
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't see it
(pause_short) Yesterday was the first time
(pause_medium) Where the (pause_medium)
going (pause_short) from being hand fed
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) Right
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) So I don't know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) or if you wanna make the time to be down there at four thirty
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) hopefully they'll do it again today
(pause_medium) I'll find out from Mark
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) Are there any particular trainers working with the penguins
(uh)
(pause_medium) hm
(pause_medium) Are all the trainers allowed to work with the pen guins
(um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all of the (pause_short) trainers work with all of the animals
(pause_short) So
(pause_medium) P Excuse me P
(pause_medium) So that the animals don't (pause_short) get (pause_medium) attached to one person
(pause_medium) then
(pause_short) a lead (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) person for each animal
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Meg is lead otter
(pause_short) Lisa Takaki was (pause_short) lead lag
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Mark is basically calling the shots
(pause_medium) for (pause_short) how the program's gonna be structured
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's the penguin trivia guy
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's a neat story
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) for s for some of us
underwater viewing gallery has not been (vocal_noises_inhalation) your favorite place
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) this (pause_short) (pause_short) could bring new light to the underwater viewing gallery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) just give a new focus on the penguins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you actually have some kinda (pause_short) neat things to interpret here
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Some other things that you might see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the penguins (pause_short) segregate themselves
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the Magellanics used to be (pause_short) off to the right
(pause_medium) and then
(pause_short) could do whatever she wan ted
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter) I k (pause_medium)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm sorry
I I k s (pause_medium)
what's number ten here (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (H)
(pause_short) the (pause_short) the penguins are numbered
(pause_short) Oh okay
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) on (pause_short) the arm
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (H)
(pause_short) okay
the (pause_short) the joint here
(pause_short) what do you call this
(pause_medium) P Humerus P
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_medium) At the humerus
Hu (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) We would have (vocal_noises_laughter) a ta g
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they're color coded
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) well how does it work
(pause_medium) When I was there
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They're colors but (vocal_noises_inhalation)
Just seven (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Did they move em to number s
(pause_medium) What it is is that
(pause_medium) green
(pause_medium) That's number twel ve
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) S o
(pause_medium) (TSK) they number them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_short) They can keep a record of what the animal eats
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she
(pause_short) because sh (pause_medium)
Because she's (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the lone feisty penguin
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that we had prior to the chicks coming in
(pause_short) (TSK) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) actually the Gentus have kind of broken up into clumps
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and there's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(TSK) let's see (pause_medium)
Let's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) G (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Let's interpret some of the behaviors we might see
(pause_medium) what is a penguin standing out with its arms like this
Its (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) Its wing s
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) actually cooling o ff
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Yeah (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) where the penguins don't have a a dense covering of feathers
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So if they wanna cool off
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay if I was to see a penguin doing this
(pause_medium) lifting one leg up
(pause_short) Isn't it
(pause_medium) What else could it be
(pause_medium) Sleeping
(pause_short) P No P
(pause_medium) Balance
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) O kay
(pause_short) the wings
(pause_medium) and the f legs
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) there's no (pause_short) dense feather coverage on the
(pause_short) on the legs
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I saw a penguin
(pause_short) (SNEEZE)
(pause_short) sneezing
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Allergic
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) I've never heard a pen guin sneezing but (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) How can you tell from it
(pause_short) like shaking his head
just like (pause_short) what a person sneezing
you can (pause_short) tell
(pause_short) When they jerk their head like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) How was
how does a penguin (pause_short) get its fresh water
(pause_medium) (TSK) How does a penguin drink
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) I haven't studied penguins in a while
(pause_medium) do you know
(pause_short) Hm mm
From (pause_medium)
I thought a way w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Drank from pools
Just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They'll drink salt wat er
all (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) also
they actually (vocal_noises_inhalation) metabolize the water
(pause_medium) that's (pause_short) stored in (pause_short) in the fat of the fish that they eat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the fresh water from the salt water
(pause_medium) actually just have to separate out that salt
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) So they have a special s (pause_medium)
(H) So that's how they're do (pause_medium)
is they're getting rid of (pause_short) the sa lt
(pause_medium) In the beak
(pause_medium) And that is what separates the salt out
(pause_medium) And to get rid of that s a lt they
(pause_short) they sneeze
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah actually
I remember doing the peng uin (pause_short) thing a year ago
but I don't remember that (pause_short) adap ta tion
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh well
(TSK) (pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) we're gonna have to go up and do Q and A
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Just looking at the clock
Who's do (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) every day
(pause_medium) P Every day P
(pause_short) when I see a penguin (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) picking its butt
(pause_short) What is it d oing
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) (pause_medium) Preening (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Kinda like
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
It's at the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation) SM What's at the base of the tail SM
(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) Well the anus is at the end of the tail
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) oh
didn't know they had meaning (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
let's say (pause_short) near (pause_short) the anus
(pause_short) What might be there
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (H) It's (pause_medium)
(Hx) (pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) that (pause_medium) stores oil
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it'll get some oil on its beak
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it's rubbing (pause_short) that (pause_short) waterproofing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) So it can keep itself water proof
(pause_short) all over its feathers
(pause_medium) Preening
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) working (pause_short) an air layer
(pause_medium) at the base of the feathers
(pause_medium) because air (pause_short) is a better insulator (pause_short) than water
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) water is like a vacuum cleaner
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's a better insulator
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So when I see a penguin dive into the water
(pause_short) what am I seeing
(pause_short) The air is r (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Is
(pause_medium) Escaping from the feathers
(pause_short) Right
From the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (CH) (CH)
(pause_short) And will start preening
(vocal_noises_inhalation) working that air layer in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) getting some oil
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) spreading it ou t
How often do the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) S ome species'll (pause_short) molt (pause_short) twice
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Twice
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) S o the last thing that a penguin does
(pause_medium) is
(pause_short) yeah
It (pause_medium) does a clean sweep
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) And then gets the new feathers on
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(um)
(pause_short) really the only training
(pause_short) That they do (pause_short) with the penguins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) The the the the training that they do with the penguins
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Uh Rockhoppers' is here
(uh) Gentus' is here
(pause_medium) unless you come to your feeding station
(pause_short) (TSK) Do they pretty much know that by now
(pause_short) Have they pretty much adapted to that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) They were still in the room
(pause_medium) O kay
(pause_short) they were pretty random (pause_medium) about it
(pause_short) because Mark would (pause_short) take
(pause_short) you know a bucket over here
(pause_short) With (pause_short) the
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) HI yeah HI
(pause_medium) I mean
the ones that were (pause_short) in there
and they (pause_medium) pretty much went
(pause_medium) where they were supposed to
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) O kay
(pause_medium) I guess
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Not I'm not (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'm not sure
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's just kind of interesting
(pause_medium) other facilities
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the training that they do with these animals is pretty minimal
they're pretty (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They can be aggressive
they have (pause_short) big teeth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) People have historically done more training
than they have (pause_short) with (vocal_noises_inhalation) other animals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) with our penguins
(pause_medium) It's kinda neat stuff
(pause_medium) Cool
(TSK) (pause_medium) Anything else
(pause_medium) For you guys
the key to the penguin (pause_short) cart
(pause_short) if you d (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The puf fin cart
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
Are (pause_medium)
Yeah the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is (pause_medium) on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you don't have to bring the whole cart out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I suggest that (pause_short) you (pause_short) check it out (pause_short) today
(um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) there's just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) There's some neat things to interpret
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Check it out
You've got (pause_short) underwater viewing
(pause_medium) At three
(pause_short) you know for Lori to go do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I'll probably me ander coast al downstairs
Cause there's a presentation (pause_medium) close to four thirty
(pause_medium) Great
(pause_medium) Never mind
(pause_short) I'll do it then
(pause_medium) When there's a presentation at three
(pause_medium) VOX Perfect VOX
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So that is penguin stuff
(pause_medium) can you guys go do Q and A
or who (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I should've cancelled it then
(pause_short) WH Guys why won't somebody do Q and A WH
(pause_short) Do it together
(pause_short) O kay
And if it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Uh what time is (pause_short) Q and A
two (pause_short) tw enty
(pause_medium) And
Where's the (um)
where's the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and as we bring them out
(pause_medium)
(pause_short) This is Bold Forbes
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He is by the stallion Irish Castle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He was bred by Lee Eaton
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy four
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Mister Estaban Tizol
(vocal_noises_inhalation) liked Bold Forbes' pedigree
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that he decided he was going to buy him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The cost ended up being fifteen thousand two hundred dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a two year old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he went off at odds of thirty five to one
(pause_short) and he won that race by seventeen lengths
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was entered into four more races
(pause_short) he won them all
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and in doing so
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So in the summer of nineteen seventy five
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In New York he won the Freemont Stakes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race
(pause_medium) So as a three year old
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But his trainer had more confidence in him than that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby
(pause_medium) one length in front of the leader
(pause_short) Honest Pleasure
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But when the Belmont rolled around
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In October
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Again he ran a very game third
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So he was retired to stud from the track
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) As a stallion
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Bold Apparel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Air Forbes One
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He was in eighteen races
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety one
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He is twenty one years old
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Ladies and gentlemen
(pause_short) Bold Forbes
(pause_short) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) Does anyone have any questions
(pause_medium) Questions
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) over here in this paddock on the right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is Sergeant Pepper Feature
he (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and only five stalls
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he had earnings of over nine hundred thousand dollars
(pause_medium) So
on your way out (pause_short) today
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) If anybody can see him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) watching the show (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions
(pause_medium) This is Imperator
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Perry
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He is out of the dam Empress Wing
(pause_short) and she is by the great sire Wing Commander
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he was purchased there as a two year old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then sent to his trainer
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They both had the same birthday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And as the years went past
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Being five gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits
(pause_short) the walk trot and canter
(vocal_noises_inhalation) plus two manmade gaits
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed
(pause_medium) Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five gaited world grand championship four times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he has also been reserve world champion five times
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was shown eighty five times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He has sixty eight blue ribbons
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now the first time Perry was shown
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But the second time he was shown
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back
(pause_short) with all four feet stuck up in the air
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) At the highlight of his career
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Perry's tail was fourteen feet long
(pause_medium) If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When Perry was retired
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Perry had been retired here for about two years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but had never had a formal retirement
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So in August of nineteen ninety one
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That night
(vocal_noises_inhalation) stepped into the ring
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen eighties
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Perry is now twenty years old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ladies and gentlemen
(pause_short) Imperator
(pause_short) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) Does anyone have any questions
while we're (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) What's the average age that a horse lives to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A good average is about twenty eight
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A a good way to compare horse ages to humans
(pause_medium) And (pause_medium)
I think the oldest liv (pause_medium)
was sixty two (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) So don't multiply that (pause_short) that one by three
(vocal_noises_laughter) That would be what
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a hundred and eighty six (pause_short) or something (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Are there any other questions
(pause_medium) No
(pause_medium) If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
I don't know if if (pause_short) anybody noticed this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there's a TV monitor right after you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Where you buy your tickets when you come in
and there's a (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_short) which was his most (pause_short) beautiful gait
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
and that was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (SNIFF) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Back there
(pause_medium) He wants to know how you say hi to a horse
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) just say hi (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) You can just say hi
and they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) cause they know their names
(pause_medium) So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator
just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And he goes by Perry
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli
(pause_short) and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda
(pause_medium) He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Due to Forego's large size
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He started his racing career as a three year old
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby
(vocal_noises_inhalation) on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he did run a fine race
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was involved in a bumping incident
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He recovered from that
(pause_short) but he and another horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) bumped through the entire stretch
(pause_medium) After the steward's inquiry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Forego had to settle for fourth
(pause_short) because the steward said the bumping was all his fault
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The older Forego got
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) over whatever distance he was asked to run
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in order to give the other horses more of a chance
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was in thirty four handicap events
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that was in the nineteen seventy six Marlboro Cup
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well before the race it had rained
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet
(pause_medium) So as the field turned for home
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year
(pause_medium) He was three years younger than Forego
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight
(pause_medium) But determined to win
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Forego made up that last quarter mile
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire
(pause_medium) The jockey that rode Forego
(vocal_noises_inhalation) said there wasn't a horse alive
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Forego was named horse of the year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he has also been champion sprinter
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards
(pause_medium) Forego retired in nineteen seventy eight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with earnings of over one point nine million dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was inducted into racing's hall of fame in nineteen seventy nine
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he is twenty four years old
and stands a very impressive (vocal_noises_inhalation) seventeen point one hands tall
(pause_medium) Ladies and gentlemen
(pause_medium) Forego
(pause_medium) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_medium) Does anyone have any questions
(pause_medium) Questions
(pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
(vocal_noises_laughter) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't have my glasses on
I couldn't see you (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Um it varies
(um)
(pause_medium) like (pause_short) probably
(pause_medium) (TSK) let's see
(pause_medium) oh about twelve hundred
(pause_medium) maybe twelve fifty
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some of the draft horses weigh over a ton
(pause_medium) in the draft horse barn
some of the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The the Shires are the tallest
And (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Have you been to the draft barn yet
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Did you see Roy and Captain
(pause_medium) SM the two big Belgians SM
(pause_medium) They weigh
(pause_short) they both weigh over two th (pause_medium)
I th (pause_medium)
I know (pause_short) Roy does
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_short) Isn't Secretariat
(pause_medium) didn't he die
(pause_short) (uh) he's buried at Claiborne Farm
(pause_medium) How did he die
(pause_medium) Pardon
(pause_short) How did he die
(pause_short) He was put down
(pause_short) which is a disease of the h (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and and they put him down
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Our next horse to come out today
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you'll see that he's a lot smaller than Forego
(pause_medium) This is John Henry
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he is out of the brood mare Once Double
(vocal_noises_inhalation) who outside of John Henry
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) John was born on March ninth nineteen seventy five
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The farm kept John until nineteen seventy six
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's usually when people try to sell the horses they don't think are worth feeding through the winter
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So because of his small size
(vocal_noises_inhalation) John brought only eleven hundred dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And from the time of this first sale
(vocal_noises_inhalation) John was sold
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and nobody could get along with him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But in May of nineteen seventy eight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) decided it would be fun to own a racehorse
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the only thing he knew about racing
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So he bought John Henry
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) John then went to New York
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In his very first New York start
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) His next race was on turf
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which John preferred to run on
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did
(vocal_noises_inhalation) advised him to send John west
(pause_short) where the turf racing was more lucrative
(pause_medium) So in late nineteen seventy nine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) John headed west
(pause_short) Ronald McAnally
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In nineteen eighty
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In nineteen eighty one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) over one point seven million dollars
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In nineteen eighty two
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but they mounted up to one point two million dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nine year old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well John did lose his first race that year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He won six graded stakes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) over two point three million dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) When John was retired in nineteen eighty four
(vocal_noises_inhalation) With earnings over six point five million dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Since then Alisheba has beat his record
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) John holds seven Eclipse Awards
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety
(pause_medium) John was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) John has been retired here for eight years now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He is nineteen years old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) fifteen point one hands tall
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Ladies and gentlemen
the great great (pause_short) John Henry
(pause_short) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_medium) Does anyone have any questions
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_short) The horses that retire here
(pause_short) These horses are (pause_short) are not ridden anymore
(um)
(vocal_noises_laughter) l like you said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they each have their own paddock
they (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and mostly they just hang out in their paddock
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they exercise themselves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's about all they do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they get lots of treats
(pause_short) s we think they're happy
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they still run around
(um)
just (pause_short) like young horses
like (pause_short) Silver
(vocal_noises_laughter) you know and do (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh) it's real cute
(uh) Forego'll run around
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Willie
(pause_short) and his little goat will get out there and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and run and
(pause_short) Imperator usually likes to trot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) They're real cute
(pause_medium) There any other questions
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) What (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Uh
(pause_short) the goat (pause_short) in with the horse
Are they just (pause_short) good friends
(pause_short) That's his little buddy (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) They're just friends
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And and he likes people
or (pause_short) Sergeant Pepper so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we don't want him to get lonely
(vocal_noises_laughter) and that's his (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) that's his little friend (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Originally they had got the goat for John Henry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they put the goat in the stall with him
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) and (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) so Willie adopted it
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
And that (pause_short) original goat died about a year ago
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Our last horse to come out today
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A standardbred races at a trot or a pace
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Willie is a pacer
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so he did show some promise
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But not long after he bought him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and his luck had been pretty bad
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The first horse he owned died
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the second horse he owned made it to the races
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And after he sold her
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and things didn't start off so well there either
(pause_medium) Willie was being raced at county fairs
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and was being beaten on a regular basis
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he was trying to decide what to get her
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Vivian was a very religious person
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So Vivian decided
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she would donate ten percent
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's when Willie's racing career took off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because of his success
(pause_short) there was a book written about Willie
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Rambling Willie
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) In order to promote his book
(pause_short) Willie would hold autograph sessions
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) One day when Willie was in New York
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he was such a hit there
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well Willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He raced from the age of two to thirteen
(pause_short) He had an incredible three hundred and five starts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He won a hundred and twenty eight times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) sixty nine times he finished second
(pause_short) and seventy nine times he paced the mile
(vocal_noises_inhalation) which is a record Willie still holds today
(pause_medium) When he retired
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with earnings over two million dollars
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he is twenty four years old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ladies and gentlemen
(pause_short) Rambling Willie
((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) Now I'll just let everybody know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we'd like to thank everyone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we hope you've had a good day
(pause_short) Thank you very much
(pause_medium) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well let's (pause_short) kind of figure out a classic
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) diet
(uh)
(pause_short) quota
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) for you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
so that we can write that (pause_short) down
((DESK_DRAWER))
(pause_medium) The way we do this
(pause_medium) is first of all
(pause_short) of how many calories
(pause_short) typically
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that you would need
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
I think (pause_short) we were gonna wait
(pause_short) cause you were gonna change some things maybe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) first of all we make a good guesstimate
(pause_short) m ost women
(vocal_noises_inhalation) unless you work out a lot
(pause_short) You probably (vocal_noises_laughter) aren't burning much more (vocal_noises_laughter) than like eighteen hundred
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to maybe (pause_short) two thousand calories
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_exhalation)
what we can do (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(um)
(pause_short) (TSK) I would say
(pause_short) Just because
(uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) I think that would be a prudent place to
(pause_short) to start out from
(pause_short) I know I won't (uh)
(pause_short) cause you to gain weight
(pause_short) you probably won't lose any either
But (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
Uh h (pause_medium)
How (um)
(pause_short) how many calories do you think I'm eating now
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(um)
(pause_short) but I'd actually need more (pause_short) amounts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Although
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I don't write down
(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) if you gave me real specific amounts
th en I could (pause_medium)
okay (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I could count your cal ories
(pause_short) I see
(pause_short) And get a printout
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
O f (pause_short) your nutrient ratio
(pause_short) Wow
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) be
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) like
(pause_short) precise
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) okay
(pause_short) point four
(pause_short) that's gonna be forty (vocal_noises_inhalation) calories
(pause_short) or excuse me
coming from carbo (pause_short) hydrate
And that's Doris's standard (vocal_noises_inhalation) protoc ol really
(pause_short) (TSK) Okay times point four
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) gives us seven hundred and twenty (pause_medium) carbohydrate (pause_short) calorie s
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) (TSK) Then we divide that (pause_short) by four
(pause_short) Calories per gram
(pause_medium) You've (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Which gives us a quota
of a hundred and eighty (pause_short) grams of carbohydrate (pause_short) per day
(pause_medium) Actually I should've done that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_short) That's low
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) That's not that much (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a bit on the higher side
(pause_medium) (TSK) And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and you al ways (pause_medium) have some kind of dinner
(pause_medium) Basical ly
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Now the mid morning snack
(pause_short) would h (pause_short) have to
(pause_short) to look at things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But usually
(pause_medium) lunch and dinner are your main (pause_short) meals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And we would give you about
(pause_short) a thirty percent quota
(pause_short) at both lunch (pause_short) and dinner
(pause_medium) which is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) about fifty (pause_short) four (pause_short) grams
(pause_medium) at each of those places
(pause_medium) Hm
Would be sort of your (pause_short) ballpark (pause_medium) quota
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) it's not outlandish
Like here (pause_short) you were sixty four
(pause_short) well
(pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Here
well you were about (uh) forty fifty nine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So sixty four
So it's (pause_medium) a little bit higher
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) (TSK)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Yes
Yeah (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
I remember (vocal_noises_exhalation)
Like (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) a long long time ago
Let's see (uh)
(pause_short) it was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I guess forty (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Or some thing
(pause_short) I think
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's m (pause_short) more
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) Let's see
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) T_sounds pretty high
That's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
A total of a hun dred and (pause_medium)
either on a higher (pause_short) calorie level
(pause_short) or
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a higher (pause_short) percent
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Which is (pause_medium) probably more realistic
(pause_short) you eat more (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) And we can change it (pause_short) up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But we'll use this as a base
(pause_short) to what you (vocal_noises_inhalation) typically do
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) the thing is if you started doing this right now
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause you've already adjusted your insulin
(pause_short) to another (pause_short) level
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But I think what you could learn from this
(pause_medium) at least
if you sort of chose a standard (vocal_noises_inhalation) place for a while
(pause_short) it might be easier
(pause_short) to do your insulin
(um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you find
(pause_short) (TSK) well
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) then you can jockey it from there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now at breakfast
(pause_short) we often keep that down around twelve
(vocal_noises_inhalation) be cause
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) point one two (pause_short) times
(vocal_noises_laughter) I thought you meant grams (vocal_noises_laughter)
where do you find (vocal_noises_inhalation) food
(vocal_noises_laughter) that's that low (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
some people actually (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) end up (vocal_noises_laughter) having to do that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's only about twenty two grams
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because of that dawn phenomenon
(pause_medium) Mm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) Unhunh
(pause_short) It's it's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) really difficult
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's see
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) okay
to distribute (pause_short) throughout (pause_short) the rest of the day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(um)
(pause_short) making a decision of how to do that
(pause_short) really involves (pause_short) your insulins
(pause_short) in the morning
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you've got a good amount
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for your snack there
I would say maybe even (pause_short) ten percent here
(pause_medium) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) See
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Having to eat snacks
(TSK) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) The on ly (vocal_noises_exhalation) t rouble with that is
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) at breakfast
(pause_short) you
(pause_short) MRC just won't have MRC (pause_short) your insulins there for you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to eat the big carbo breakfast
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Unless
you (pause_short) run high
(pause_short) after breakfast
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when the insulins finally do get working
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But then you're run ning high
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you run high for an hour and a half
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down
(H) When all the insulins (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) get on board (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(um)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I wonder how (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_exhalation) How does Doris do that though
(pause_short) I mean
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
she just like (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) has this really minimal (pause_medium) dose of NPH
(pause_short) I think
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You'd have to ask her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) That's what (uh) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
I don't know the (vocal_noises_laughter) trade secrets there (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) but (uh)
h (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know I think
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) probably
(pause_short) um
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) keeping the carbos (pause_short) a little on the lower side
enable (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Of course then you'd need less insulin
(pause_short) Mhm
Cause you don't have to take these big (vocal_noises_inhalation) amounts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) this actually
(pause_medium) (TSK) Now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) mid afternoon
(pause_medium) but you don't really (pause_medium) eat much of a snack
(pause_medium) Usually
(pause_medium) After lunch
(pause_medium) might have some Cheetos there I see
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) couldn't eat dinner (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) where
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) as a place to start
(pause_medium) (uh) why'd I do that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And that's just (pause_short) hardly anything
That's a f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) um
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) then later on
Cause you're (pause_short) kind of a nightowl
(pause_short) and um
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) let's see this'll go twenty two
(pause_short) plus
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) thirteen fifteen percent there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) so
(pause_medium) okay so
(pause_medium) essentially like breakfast
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) (TSK) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) those would just be places (pause_short) to start from
((PAPER_TEAR)) (pause_short) But I think
(um)
(pause_short) what's even more im portant
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) is
well this is (pause_short) ridiculous
I always have (pause_short) a seventy (vocal_noises_inhalation) carbo dinner
(pause_short) so what
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) there's nothing wrong with that
it just (pause_short) means
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you slightly (pause_short) adjust (pause_short) that insulin
(pause_short) Same thing if you (vocal_noises_inhalation) don't like snacks
(pause_short) what are you gonna do (pause_short) to compens ate
(pause_short) for the fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that
(pause_short) there's (pause_short) there's a lotta insulin there maybe
(pause_short) And (um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) how are you gonna get around that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK) but that's the sole purpose of snacks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) lows from happening
(pause_short) and to (pause_short) counteract
(um)
(pause_short) the insulin (pause_short) time (pause_short) actions
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_exhalation)
M (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh (pause_medium)
Maybe we should compare (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Go ahead
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
say I (pause_short) didn't eat lunch
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then what would happen
(pause_short) Like
(pause_short) then I could not take (pause_short) the insulin there
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) And then
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
you probably would need to eat (pause_short) a little something
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
of your NPH (pause_short) peaking
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) although
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you don't take (pause_medium) a lot of NPH
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) In the morning yeah
(pause_short) It may be debatable
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) later in the af
(uh) or
b (pause_short) to get you into dinner
(pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) (TSK)
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) Um
y (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Doris could (pause_short) help you with that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Did she give you a scale for a w no lunch
(pause_short) lunch (pause_short) scale
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A w while ago
but (um)
(pause_medium) it changed after that
(pause_short) See this was the original thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) That I had
(pause_short) She said
but (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Okay
this was (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) hm
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) This was a while ago (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) three twenty four ninety four
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) like
she had these two (pause_short) things
so if I (pause_short) was gonna eat
(pause_short) like say I
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I decided ok
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then
(pause_short) I would (pause_short) take four
(pause_medium) units of NPH and then
(pause_short) supplement it
(pause_medium) with the regular
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but if I knew
(pause_short) like say in the morning
(pause_short) That I wasn't gonna eat lunch
(pause_medium) Then
she said take (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) To me
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) You know
In in the (pause_short) afternoon
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Cause
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it was before
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I had real ly (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Definitely
(um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) on your insulins
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
is the only one that can really (pause_medium) clarify them
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's tough
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
to do (vocal_noises_inhalation) the jockeying of of the food
(um)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(um)
(pause_short) a a challenge there to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
this is where I got the idea that she d (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
Well (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I don't know how she would have time
(vocal_noises_laughter) anyway
it's like (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know five minutes here
but (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then
(pause_short) also
just like (um)
(pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_short) Unhunh
it's such a pain to have to (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) stop and eat lunch
You know (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
(um)
(pause_medium) that's where I got that idea
(pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
And so (pause_short) four of N
(pause_short) six of N
(pause_medium) and then zero regular there
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's where just monitoring
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) R ight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well anyway
how can I (pause_medium)
How can I help you (vocal_noises_laughter) with all this (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
I feel like (uh)
we're (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) still in a pickle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in that (um)
(pause_short) it's just
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(uh)
(pause_short) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the carbos (pause_short) are varying (pause_short) around that
(um)
(pause_short) (TSK) but
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) make some kind of a a goal
to (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) prevent these lows from happening
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a nd (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) (TSK) that (uh) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you could do
to h (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) clarify this a little bit (vocal_noises_laughter) more and
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(pause_short) M (pause_short) maybe that's the only way
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause it seems like to me that (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) P I don't know P
(pause_short) I don't know
It's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) if I have like some kind of set thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Kinda
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Cause otherwise
I'll just do whatever I (vocal_noises_laughter) feel like doing
you know (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(H) (pause_short) Uh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (H)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) you you could give this a try
(pause_short) is use
(pause_short) what you're currently doing as sort of a backup (pause_short) guide
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because
(pause_short) obviously
But (um)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) well one day you have thirty eight at breakfast
(pause_short) The next day (pause_short) you have (pause_short) none
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Yeah but that's like if it 's high
Cause (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_short) you know
and what you could do is sort of (pause_short) round these
Like shoot for say (pause_short) twenty five
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) just say every morning
(H) That's (um)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it it would work
you know that a thirty (pause_short) gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement
(vocal_noises_inhalation) on what you were doing
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) dropping it down a little bit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and yet
(pause_short) s it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast
(pause_short) or br ead
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so you could just lock into that
(pause_short) And (uh)
(pause_short) see see how that goes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) mid morning
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) but
(pause_short) try it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a plastic baggie full of crackers
(pause_short) That you (pause_short) take wi th you wherev er you go
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and just make it a standard habit
(pause_short) M hm
it could be (pause_short) a piece of fruit
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That is gonna be approximately in that ballpark
(pause_medium) (TSK) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) lunchtime
(pause_short) I I would say maybe rounding it
(pause_short) I might round it to sixty
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) so what if we increase your (pause_short) quota up to about (pause_short) forty five per cent
(pause_short) That that's not the most important thing
The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas (pause_short) consistently
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_short) (TSK) here
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if anything it's
(pause_short) trying to maybe keep this down
(pause_short) Mhm
Aroun d (pause_short) fifteen to thirty
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) I agree
that if you can make it a little more (pause_short) rock steady
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you should (pause_short) be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to (pause_short) to go for
(pause_medium) (TSK) But these are a little bit more scientifically (vocal_noises_inhalation) derived
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) what insulins are doing
(pause_short) a a and when
(pause_medium) So
(TSK) (H) (pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) Hm
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) BR Oh BR
(vocal_noises_exhalation) amount of carbohydrate at dinner
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) You know
With your (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) is keep (pause_medium) this one
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) because lunch
(pause_short) well what are you gonna have really
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Maybe realistically
this is only (pause_short) about
(pause_short) forty
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I would just (pause_medium) adjust this
(pause_short) fifty
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But dinner
(pause_short) in that you have a regular sliding scale
(pause_medium) (TSK) and
(pause_short) realistically you should make this (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) seventy
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) but
(pause_short) but call it seventy
and then really try (vocal_noises_inhalation) to stand by that
(pause_short) And look at the insulin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and what does happen over the course of the evening
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) or what
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
But (pause_short) but look at it and see
Make it like (pause_short) seventy
and then just (pause_medium) stick to it
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Mhm
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) O kay
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
That's something you could (pause_medium) play with for (uh) a little while
and see if if it (um) (pause_short) helps
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) in (pause_short) getting rid of some of the outliers
That we're (pause_short) trying to (pause_short) fix up
(pause_medium) So
(vocal_noises_inhalation) um
(pause_medium) other questions
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) What'd you do Sabrina
(pause_medium) Nothing
(pause_medium) I left the phone in my bedroom (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) last night
and so I'm grounded from the phone (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (YAWN)
(pause_medium) It was an accident

(pause_short) And so she comes in
she says I apologize for (pause_short) for being late and everything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we might have to scrape windows out here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And so she went into the community afterwards
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX it hasn't been a good morning VOX she says
(pause_short) (TSK) (pause_short) I bought (pause_short) four five pairs of (pause_short) new pants
(pause_short) She goes and I didn't bother to try em on before (pause_short) I left
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So she's all of em (pause_short) are not short enough
(pause_short) these are the shorter one
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_short) she brought bought a brand new attache case

to find something that a s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That you can do just being there
(pause_medium) an hour a week
(SNIFF) (pause_short) But sometimes you get bored
I mean I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Watching the same class for twenty hours
it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It helps you
(pause_short) plus
(pause_short) it also helps pass the time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so I told Mickey

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He he
(pause_short) he's become more (pause_short) attached
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) (uh) I think a lot of it is because a lot of his
(pause_short) friends have now gotten married
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he doesn't (pause_short) do as much with them
(pause_medium) And I think that's why
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I've always been very independent
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and a lot of it had to do with like me growing up the way I did
with my (pause_short) my (um)
(pause_short) my mother dying
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then moving to another aunt
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) I I've always had to go back and forth
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) I've always done everything
when my nephew (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) started college
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she filled out all of his applications for where he was going and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she did all of these things when he had to apply for a scholarship or whatever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she filled out everything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you read the form
(pause_short) and you fill it out
(pause_short) Wow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
and I was very (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) much
(pause_short) whatever I needed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I I got my money from my father
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(pause_short) I I didn't have anyone
(pause_short) They're not (pause_short) extremely educated
(pause_short) really on top of things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and so when it came to things like that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
they wouldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I mean they had no clue
(vocal_noises_inhalation) oh yeah go to school
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We want you to go to school
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
Se (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Yeah
I I see this with (vocal_noises_inhalation) with black (pause_short) youths today
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) because your generations in the past
(pause_short) Mm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you have a harder time deciding on what's a good school
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what's a good curriculum for you to take
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) your your parents aren't able to talk to you about it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) W just as you were saying
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but black children have that (pause_short) even more so
Because you har (pause_medium)
You're you're more likely (pause_short) not to be ha come from educated parents
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Whereas I came from an educated family
(pause_short) it was just the fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) they made us do everything on our own
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) black people also
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I think they instilled s tried m tried to make me so strong
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that they forgot
(pause_medium) that I was a person
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (TSK) and maybe it's the gayness coming out in me but
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't like it
(pause_short) just went home to Indiana
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I went to hug my sister
(pause_short) and I still feel that she finds a coldness in hugging
(pause_medium) She doesn't like to hug
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) we've never been very
(pause_medium) and even like male female
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You don't do it
(pause_medium) See (uh) my (pause_short) my mother was like that more so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then my father was (pause_short) different
(pause_short) Very emotional
they were just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) See my family is more
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) each member of the family is slightly different
(pause_short) and different a amount of (pause_short) touch
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I always said
(pause_medium) that if I had children
(pause_medium) I would always (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't think you can overly hug
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) with family and stuff like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I want to hug him
(pause_short) I I I want my children
(pause_short) if I if I ever had children
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) kept calling him Aunt Scott
(pause_medium) Because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) he he unwrapped
(vocal_noises_inhalation) oh that's just the way kids are today
(vocal_noises_inhalation) no that's the way you train your kids
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) If you don't train your kids to be any better
(pause_medium) then they are
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he'll tease Scott about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he'll laugh it off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he doesn't realize
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it hurts Scott
(pause_short) He doesn't know that he's gay
(pause_short) (THROAT) Hm mm
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_short) Has no idea
(pause_short) He's probably he's gonna drop him off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But (uh)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) it it's the way (pause_medium) he is
(pause_short) And so
(pause_short) he
(pause_medium) and h and so his little boy is growing up the same way
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he's like this big kid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I wouldn't take it personal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) first of all
(pause_short) Larry's twelve years old
(pause_short) he's like six foot one
(pause_short) I mean
he's just (pause_short) probably a good two hundred fifty pounds I said
(pause_medium) At twelve
(pause_medium) At twelve years old
(pause_short) And he's like two hundred and fifty pounds
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said Scott he's compensating
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for the fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I said so therefore
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he probably is a big bully at school
(pause_short) And I said
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) real (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) bitter
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because nobody (pause_medium)
And I said his dad is just an (pause_short) a a jerk
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) will call our house
(pause_short) is just (pause_short) rude to Scott
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But yet he'll turn around and ask Scott to borrow five thousand dollars
(pause_medium) I mean like he just borrowed twenty five thousand dollars from Scott
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) like two years ago
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
he gives Scott (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It takes him instead
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Like w (pause_short) Scott's got twenty five thousand dollars just to lay around
(pause_short) Like that
(pause_short) You know and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that's the way his brother is
(pause_short) You know very
(pause_medium) and he's just
(pause_short) he's just mean to Scott
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) just like
(pause_medium) oh just awful things about gay and
(pause_short) why does n't (pause_short) Scott say something
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Because
(pause_short) Scott hasn't dealt with his gayness himself
(pause_medium) who he is
(pause_medium) And that's why he doesn't say anything
(pause_medium) So you can't really blame the guy in the sense that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I keep tell ing Scott
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because all of these things are hurting you
(pause_medium) VOX Yeah VOX
(pause_medium) I said i if that would have been my nephew
VOX (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I said my nephews d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) one of the little gi rls
f (uh)
tried pulling something on (pause_medium)
(pause_short) We went shopping
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and tried the little attitude in the in the mall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I grabbed her and I said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I will knock you across that bench
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
I just it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's right
(pause_short) They do talk bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's not an excuse
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Hello
(pause_medium) Hello
(pause_medium) What's wrong
(pause_medium) P It's Jimmy P
(pause_medium) SM Why
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Why
(vocal_noises_inhalation) SM
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) alright
Wel (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) If you don't have enough gas and you're worried
I wouldn't go anywhere (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) either (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (TSK) So why don't you call (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Bye
(pause_short) ((PHONE_BEEP))
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) He's afraid that he's gonna run out of gas getting over here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
(pause_short) just on that
(pause_short) make it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so he said he's like
it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and so he's afraid
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that he'll run out on his way over here
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) Well he should just
(pause_short) go to a gas station
So he said he'll (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well there's one down the street from his house
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_medium) Instead
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I don't know
(pause_short) it's hard
(pause_short) it's it is hard having
(pause_medium) to hide this like Scott's doing
(pause_medium) he's hiding it way too long
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) I told my mother when I had like
(pause_medium) my (pause_short) boyfriend moved away
(pause_medium) (TSK) She s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mm
(pause_short) Cause I was really upset
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then I s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And then she's like
cause he was sort of (pause_short) effeminate
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) and I was really offended
(pause_short) That's how she took it
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) And I was really offended
(pause_medium) And I said VOX what do you mean he was weird VOX
(pause_short) And she said he was sort of effeminate
(pause_short) And I was like
(pause_medium) And I said well (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) why
(pause_short) And she's like
(pause_medium) no
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) yes I am
(pause_short) I said
(pause_medium) how do you know me
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) And she's just (vocal_noises_laughter) looking at me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) she ended up telling him I think eventually
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) First thing I had to go to see a a psychiatrist
(pause_short) (TSK) Oh she made you go do that
(pause_short) I went
(pause_medium) Oh Jim's mother told him that too
(pause_short) (TSK) See and then I went
(pause_short) and the guy's like really nice
(pause_short) tell me what's (pause_short) what's going on
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said well
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Nineteen
(pause_short) And she said that's for the psychiatrist at nineteen
(pause_short) enough about yourself at that age
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) Well
some (pause_short) to some extent
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So then I went to the psychiatrist and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's like well what's the problem
(pause_short) (TSK) my mother's upset because I'm gay
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he's like
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) And I didn't even think about how I said it
(pause_medium) And he interpreted w how I said it
(pause_short) as how it was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know what's really f unny
(pause_short) and knowingly know that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) like when Mike told his friend Julia
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Mike was telling me that Julia said
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) oh I don't like it
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) I said to Mike
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) he said
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) well
(pause_short) I think she accepted it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he told her that he feels he was born with it
(pause_medium) no
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said to (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I hate when people say that
(pause_short) if I felt that was my choice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I don't think that would've been the first choice I would've picked
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it's not to say that I'm ash amed of being gay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because of what society has done
or has (vocal_noises_inhalation) laid the rules for us
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't really think I would have chose to be gay
(pause_short) I I wouldn't
(pause_short) Why would I want to be gay
(pause_medium) Exactly
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and they (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) totally believe that it's
(pause_short) like (pause_short) hereditary or genetic or whatever
(pause_short) You know
because (pause_medium)
They totally b (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh
I believe it's (pause_short) it's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I do believe it's something
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's a gene
I I don't (pause_short) think (pause_medium)
You you are (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) gosh
(pause_short) probably
(pause_short) I can remember
(pause_short) Five years old
I re member (pause_short) looking (pause_short) at
(pause_medium) my uncle was sleeping
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) on the couch
(pause_medium) in our family room
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
and his (pause_short) peepee fell out of his pants
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And I just stood there and stared at it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) an d I was (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
cause I can remember feeling sexually (pause_short) interested
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) So I knew then
(pause_short) You you know what you feel inside
You you c you can't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I don't care what anybody says
I pick (pause_medium)
That I (pause_medium) liked (pause_short) what I saw
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that I could actually just say oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) wow
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) And and if they say things like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) oh when I was maybe seven
(pause_medium) I slept with my cousin Tommy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) At the time
(pause_medium) no he was sixteen
(pause_short) Shared a bed with him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_medium) started fondling me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was like (pause_short) seven years old
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_short) I (pause_short) I don't say that he did it to me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the older uncle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) generally
(pause_medium) Hm
(pause_short) not saying adults should've been more responsible
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
(pause_short) he did
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I'm not gonna turn around and tell my aunt
(pause_short) gee your son
(pause_short) mol ested me as a child
(pause_medium) He's not gay
(pause_short) Well
(pause_short) we don't know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Actually
(pause_short) I think he is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) Oh yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) But
(pause_medium) at the time no
he ha (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Like when he turned twenty two
he got (pause_short) married
he has (pause_short) kids
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he (pause_short) just is very
(pause_short) that was what happened to me
And (pause_short) and I don't blame my cousin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when I was growing up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember watching one of our neighbors
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I remember being mesmerized by his body
(pause_medium) I was never really that mesmerized by a female's body
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's why I don't understand where (uh) (pause_short) they come up with this of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's your choice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that that's what I felt
(H) I remember when I was li (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with my brothers
(pause_medium) Just like (pause_short) goofing around and stuff like that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then I think the l (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The experience when I was younger
and my (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)older brothers had (pause_short) friends over
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I remember the f (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He he he (pause_short) come over with these friends
(pause_medium) in lust
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I must have been like nine or ten
and I was just like (pause_medium) idolizing these guys
(pause_medium) I remember
(pause_short) if I could have them in my bedroom
(pause_short) See th yeah
(pause_medium) You know
of oh if (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Li as if they were like a to y or something
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That was my older brother
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) played football at Perdue
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I used to go to games
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) these guys would like tickle me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I probably (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mm
(pause_short) I was probably about ten at the time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they just thought I was the nicest little boy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I just had
(pause_short) And (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know these things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you know it's inside of you
(pause_short) A nd
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) what what do you do
(pause_short) And I know my brother
(pause_medium) who lives in Dallas
(uh)
he (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He knew it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He (pause_short) he knew
he knew especially after (vocal_noises_laughter) Ron
(pause_short) because when I left California
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't come back here first
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Because my brother's like come and stay with me
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you can look for a job down here
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And so
(pause_short) Ron flew to Dallas
(pause_short) and went to my brother's house
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) this is really odd for two friends
(pause_short) to be this emotionally attached
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I was like crying all the time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and like when Ron came
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and (pause_short) blah blah blah
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) Oh my God (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Having a
(pause_short) Th a thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) let me talk to him let me talk to him
(pause_medium) it is a little weird
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he really liked him a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) until that episode
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) Really
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Why
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) No h
I think (pause_medium) I'm afraid
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) I'm afraid that he's gonna come right out and ask me
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) about it
(pause_short) and coming back (pause_short) to Wisconsin like a week later
(pause_short) For holidays at all or anything
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) Are you serious (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) see I don't have any family in Wisconsin
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So when he comes home
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He did call me one time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) because he needed me to se sign a property agreement
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) My (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So he called
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and left me a message
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and

(vocal_noises_inhalation) He was the one that I told
(pause_medium) that if he'd had told me he loved me
(pause_short) I would have never left Washington and moved with Ron
I would have (pause_medium) stuck with Darren
(pause_short) I would have never
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause I never really
(pause_short) like I said
(pause_short) And I knew Ron was my friend
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
(pause_short) When I was in college
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) if Scott wasn't here
and (pause_short) Darren wasn't married to a woman
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I would be with Darren
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was probably (pause_short) the best (pause_medium) sexual partner
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) could ever imagine
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
SM (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we never had sex SM

(pause_short) Not
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) Not the booty dance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) The booty dance (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_laughter)(H)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Wow (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
We (pause_short) had um
(pause_medium) You had oral sex
(pause_short) But he was just
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and fine
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I don't like men with like auburn hair
(pause_short) But he had auburn hair
(pause_short) six foot
(pause_short) oh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and he still is
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he is to die for
(pause_short) I thought
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) WH why WH (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He was the one that blamed me
P (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) P
(pause_short) And we messed around
(pause_short) But yet he was the one that grabbed me and threw me on the floor
(pause_short) He confronted you and said that to you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I called him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he said I don't want to talk to you
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you took advantage of me when I was drunk
(vocal_noises_inhalation) kissed me
(pause_medium) took my underwear off
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) he started it
(pause_medium) You know
I knew (pause_short) what I was about
(pause_short) I (pause_short) didn't (pause_short) get into it
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he didn't speak to me for three months
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) because he blamed me for that
(pause_short) the third experience he blamed me for
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's been blaming me for all of these experiences
(pause_medium) (uh) like
(pause_short) Scott and I got serious like the year after
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I went out to Washington and stuff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that's when he stopped blaming me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he calls me and tells me that he wants to be with me
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) he called (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You're kidding
(pause_short) No
(pause_short) But he's married to Lauren
(pause_medium) And I keep telling him
(pause_short) before you have children
(pause_medium) Just get out of it
(pause_short) don't carry any by baggage with you
(pause_medium) Always my biggest theory
(pause_short) Mm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he loves her
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he loves her but he's not in love with her
(pause_medium) You know what I mean
he he just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) but (pause_short) you're not in love with them
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's really har d
(pause_short) Because
(pause_medium) you you find it very difficult to be
(pause_short) to love someone and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they misunderstand
(pause_medium) (TSK) I don't know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think if there was ever anybody
(pause_short) I truly (pause_medium)
But he k (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) everybody has that one person who breaks their heart
(pause_short) Just incredibly because
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I wasn't really in love with his looks
(pause_medium) I've never met anybody who when you (pause_short) they touched you
(pause_short) there was so much warmth
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) just (pause_medium)
There was so much (pause_short) energy there
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That
(pause_short) I mean
(TSK) So you've (pause_short) kept in con tact with him
P (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Mm P
(pause_short) yes
Since nineteen (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) That's ama zing
(pause_short) What does he just call
P when he's P (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He calls me
(pause_medium) I can't call him
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Actually I can
(pause_short) But I don't choose to call him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Like he used to travel
they live (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) they just moved
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He quit his job for her
(pause_medium) for her (pause_short) job
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So he used to travel all around the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well whenever he come to Wisconsin for the dairy expo
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) go to Chicago for (pause_short) some reason
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what he did was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh)
he took f (uh) farmers around from arou different parts of the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So his travel a lot of times was in Wisconsin
(pause_short) because of the farms here
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They would see how (pause_short) things were done and
he (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He like took them around (pause_short) (TSK) the world
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know doing this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) See
(pause_medium) I think Darren now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) he's with Lauren all the time
(pause_medium) And before
(pause_medium) He was gone
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_medium) So now he's with Lauren (pause_short) every day
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I think k (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) For the last three or four months
Oh (pause_medium)
He just started stop (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He just stopped trav eling
(pause_medium) And I think now it's just like
(pause_medium) I don't know if this is for me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he's starting to call me
and I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I know that you're with Scott
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I'm just like
(pause_medium) and I'm not giving up my life for you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He asked me once
(pause_medium) when I came back
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he asked me to move to Madison
(pause_medium) To be with him
(pause_short) That was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe I am gay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I said
(pause_medium) well
(pause_short) why don't I come out there first
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he goes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment
(pause_medium) and lived by himself
(pause_medium) okay
until I find (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It was just like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and then he wanted the still straight life
(pause_medium) and this and that and other
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but he's moving closer I think to steps of being gay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) because when he was talking to me on the phone last week
(pause_medium) he was telling me how much he still loved me
(pause_medium) And he doesn't know what to do about this whole sit uation
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He doesn't know me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we talked to each other maybe once a month
(pause_medium) Well that's quite a bit though
(vocal_noises_inhalation) like he went to Germany for six weeks
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Cause he was there
(pause_short) training to t speak
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he sent me
(pause_short) a free k to (pause_short) to come and spend a week with him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But at that time
(pause_short) I would been with Scott like four years
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) I don't think so
for your little sex thing for that (vocal_noises_inhalation) week
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(pause_medium) I st I love him
(pause_short) I real ly do but
I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I also don't trust him
(pause_short) I don't think any man
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) who (pause_medium) is as sexual as he w (pause_short) is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and traveled as much as he did
(pause_short) could stay
(pause_short) celibate
(pause_short) Right
(pause_short) I mean when y I saw him once in Chicago
(pause_medium) I went to Chicago
(pause_short) About (pause_short) four years ago
(pause_short) Five years ago
(pause_medium) And he was in Chicago
and he (vocal_noises_inhalation) said
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) and Sunday
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I thought okay no big deal
he'll have (pause_short) a room with two double beds
(pause_short) No it was a king size bed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I thought
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) taking my sleeping bag
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) and (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It was more than five years ago
(pause_medium) no
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So it was more than six years ago because
(pause_short) it was when he asked Lauren to marry him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So it's been about six and a half years so
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he asked Lauren to marry him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he says I really love Lauren
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I get in the bed
(pause_short) I'm wearing my t shirt and my underwear
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and in the morning I wake up
(pause_short) and here he is
(pause_medium) fondling me
(pause_medium) (TSK) So I'm like
(pause_medium) You know
so (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) I'm like Darren
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) he goes
(pause_medium) this isn't right
(pause_short) you don't really want to be with me
(pause_short) you just want (pause_short) the sexual part
(pause_medium) And I said that's all there is to it
(pause_medium) And (pause_medium) he accepted it
and I I don't know (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He always
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well how's Scott
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) how is your sex life with Scott
(pause_short) Are you happy with Scott
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I'm like
(pause_short) well Darren I haven't told you I missed you in years
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Is he like full of himself or what
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he's another one too
He knows (pause_short) he's (pause_short) good looking
(pause_short) When we were were in college
(pause_short) Mm
(pause_short) And (pause_short) and what really gets me is th (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) that
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think
(pause_short) the reason I always attracted
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is people always (pause_short) got the impression (pause_short) I was gay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
and they wanted some (pause_short) experience
and they (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they didn't want to approach another (pause_short) say man in your frat
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And they kinda thought you were gay
and nobody really wanted to (vocal_noises_inhalation) like say it
(pause_short) they would approach me
(pause_short) Mm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I always got all the good looking ones to always like
(pause_short) come after me
(pause_short) P Mm P
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know I always think well
I mean (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) he was just like (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) oh
(pause_short) just (pause_short) perfect
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Darren
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a lot of people don't like auburn hair or reddish brown hair
They don't (pause_short) ca care for it
But Ron just is just a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) just a beautiful man
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I find that that's what happens in these fraternities
Is you find a man who (pause_short) is curious about his sexuality
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And if they find someone who they question
(pause_short) okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) then they will tend to (pause_short) go after you a little bit faster
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So then you think
(pause_medium) (TSK) like I was out (pause_short) at the Triangle
(vocal_noises_inhalation) how the hell did he end up with that (pause_short) VOX thing VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then I thought you know
I betcha he's just out (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he (pause_short) was just finding out
(pause_short) and that's why he was out with him
it (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) This was probab (pause_medium)
This was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
Well the w (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They were young
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The one guy in particular was young
(pause_short) Mm
I f (pause_medium)
I wouldn't think he would be more than (pause_medium) twenty
(pause_medium) twenty one
I couldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_short) but
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_short) no
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he was just very nice
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation) Ow
(pause_short) Is he still a virgin
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) But
was he (pause_short) a (pause_short) virgin when you knew him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (COUGH)
(pause_medium) I meant
has he ever had a (pause_short) girl where he didn't have to pay her
(pause_short) Oh oh
(pause_medium) he got
(pause_short) like
(pause_short) I told you about the time he got like (pause_short) a blowjob (pause_short) at the lakefront
(pause_medium) No
(pause_short) Um
(pause_short) I was just
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) me and Janine
well let me (pause_short) back up here
(pause_short) I started hanging out with Janine
(pause_medium) Janine and I got smashed
and we (pause_short) like (pause_short) made out at the lakefront
(pause_short) I don't need the de tails
(pause_short) Oh cool
(pause_medium) (SNIFF) how's she doing
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) (um)
we were like (pause_short) making out and stuff at Duncan lakefront
did this like th (pause_short) two three times
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So after Victor's
(pause_medium) fighting over who he's gonna go home with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he went home with this like (uh)
(pause_short) one other girl
(vocal_noises_inhalation) me and Janine and all of us were walking down the hill
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) where the pier is
(pause_medium) Except
(pause_medium) And it's like (uh)
(pause_medium) me and Janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So we hurried up and went in the grassy part
(pause_short) by the tennis courts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It was real dark
after we had gotten (pause_short) to that little plank
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You know and they
(pause_short) started making out
(pause_short) a hundred yards away from us
(pause_short) (SNIFF) (TSK) You know
(pause_short) but there's trees
(pause_medium) in front of a tree
(pause_short) so you couldn't see them
and we were sitting by (pause_short) like (pause_short) a tree
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so you couldn't see us
(pause_medium) So they were making out
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and we're sitting there talking and stuff and junk
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all of a sudden we hear
(pause_medium) (LIPS)
(pause_medium) and that was just the damndest noise
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(pause_medium) I'm like
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) I know they're not (vocal_noises_laughter) doing what I think they're doing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and we're looking around the corner
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then all of a sudden
(pause_medium) Tom I don't know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Or something
and then I saw (pause_medium) a head
Or a movement (pause_short) lower (pause_medium) than what I saw Tom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he's getting (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) head from this chick he didn't even know
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) I don't know if he
(pause_short) it was getting late and she had to work in the morn ing
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) He's only paid for it
(pause_medium) Did he pay for it back home
(pause_medium) well
(pause_short) it's kind of a good price
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) nowadays here
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) pay fifty bucks to go out to dinner and a movie
and then you have to be (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) real nice
(pause_medium) and then maybe just maybe
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if the wind's blowing in the right direction and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) WH just WH no one tripped over anything earlier in that day
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) take fifty bucks
(pause_short) go out (vocal_noises_laughter) with your friends (vocal_noises_laughter) and have some fun
(pause_short) Or you could always go down to that one strip in Chicago

I just thought (pause_short) you'd find it interesting
(pause_medium) Anyways cool
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) What is this guy doing now
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) ((DOOR_OPENING))
(pause_medium) Hey man
(pause_medium) Good to see you
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) well
(pause_medium) I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there
(pause_short) I did
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Yeah
I mean I couldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I couldn't begin to deal with the slightest pressure
yeah don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Tha t still hur ts back here
(pause_short) yeah
(pause_medium) Well
you don't want to (pause_short) stretch
you st (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Ch (pause_medium)
(pause_short) According to this other guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if they get
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you know
you want to let em (pause_short) heal as strong as they can
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but you don't wanna stretch those (pause_medium) ligaments very much when
Just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Just gradually bring it around
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Just walking around
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) it was really (pause_short) icy there
(pause_short) it had a spike on it
so I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) If you forget
Bet you (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) No
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Let me set you up there
I (pause_medium)
I alread y have (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It's for a pro ject
(pause_medium) Cool
(pause_medium) Alright
I thought you were doing something (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) different
I thought you were working with languages in (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Okla homa
(pause_medium) Or in California
Yeah that's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I did a year of it
(pause_short) what I really l (pause_medium)
cause I really don't know quite what I want (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Well that's alright
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_short) I hope so (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I move to O klahoma
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Completely
he (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) He (uh) graduated from medical school this year and (uh)
I mean he's in (uh)
(pause_medium) Soho in New York
(pause_medium) Reall y
S tarting an art (pause_short) career
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) so you see
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
and just see whether he can do well enough with th at to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Did he spec ialize at all
he (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) pulled him toward it
(pause_medium) and so he said well
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you know (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and
(pause_short) I think
(pause_short) see what happens
you got (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You got plenty of (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There's (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) fortunately
(pause_medium) this day and time I think it allows
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) one to
(pause_short) proceed like you're and
I would've d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
although I r (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) I didn't make the wrong decision for me
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) I'm sure I would have been a lot more
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) I guess
(vocal_noises_inhalation) in
you really kinda just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) There wasn't too many things to do
you (pause_short) too many opportunities
(vocal_noises_inhalation) chose between a few
(pause_short) that was it
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) a little simpler lifestyle in those days
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Tell me where it hurts
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) still a little bit back here
(pause_short) Mm kay
Doesn't feel quite normal (pause_short) back there
(pause_medium) un der (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It (pause_short) originall y hurt (pause_medium)
It would (pause_medium)
I think it did at fir (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He drew some blood out
(pause_short) from here the first time
(pause_medium) Cause
(vocal_noises_inhalation) usually when they're torn bad
(pause_medium) Is that doing anything
(pause_short) Nothing bad really
(pause_medium) Which one hurts more
(pause_short) back
(pause_medium) or forward
(pause_medium) They're about the same
(pause_short) Mm kay
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well see
(pause_medium) Watch this one
(pause_medium) See I'm pushing back now
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) and I'm pulling forward
and it (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You get a little bit of pull
(pause_medium) coming forward it
(pause_short) it (pause_short) moves out a little bit
(pause_short) and
(pause_medium) tight
(pause_medium) It's got a good catch to it you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) we're gonna pull
(pause_medium) pull it out
(pause_medium) Wow it doesn't have that same movement
(pause_medium) It's got a little more (pause_short) forward movement
(pause_medium) and it
(pause_short) kinda
(pause_medium) has a
(pause_short) so (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) chances are (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) you've (uh) hurt that
(pause_medium) (uh) ligament in the back too
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_short) The crossband
(pause_short) Mhm yeah
The (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Call (pause_medium)
I don't know what (pause_medium)
th they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and one (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) They cross because one's going forward and one's going backwards
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Yeah
Your posterior's (pause_medium) messed up a little bit
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Well
(pause_medium) Uh (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) mm
(pause_medium) P get a little better maybe P
(pause_medium) It's not gonna get all the way right
(pause_medium) Mm
It'll be (pause_short) a little bit of a problem
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm not sure you didn't maybe have some of that before
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) let me see w (pause_short) how much this hurts here
(pause_short) Mm
(pause_medium) None
(pause_medium) Mm mm
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) My main physical activity
(pause_medium) ((DOOR_CLOSING))
(pause_medium) Mm kay
(pause_short) Lot of rolling
lot of (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The knees do take something from that
I believe that they (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) A lot of work on em
Any of those (pause_medium) things gotta (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) put some kinda (pause_short) stress on your leg
(pause_short) I definitely want to get back to it though
(pause_medium) I had to lay off it for a while
(pause_medium) That (pause_medium) hurts right over here
(pause_medium) It's not too bad though
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_short) It's just very mild
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
that (pause_medium)
That one could probably (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) See look at the difference on here now
what (pause_short) see (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) See how much of a jiggle you got there
you got just (pause_medium) a little laxity there
(pause_short) And this one's just (pause_short) a hair different
I mean it (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But it hurts
(pause_short) A bit
(pause_short) Uh
(pause_short) It hurt a lot at first
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_short) so
(pause_medium) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
and that's the posterior (pause_medium) ex band
if you want to put it (pause_short) like that
(pause_medium) (SNIFF)
(pause_medium) (TSK) Uh
(pause_medium) seems to be the problem
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) but it's not (uh)
(pause_medium) I'm not sure you didn't have a little bit of that problem before
(pause_medium) It isn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) All these years since the wreck
the (pause_short) the leg's never felt
(pause_medium) it's never been t otally norm al but
did your knee feel like it would (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Sorr that hurt s a bit
(pause_short) Where did that get you
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Did your knee feel like it (pause_medium) had some play in it
(pause_short) I don't remember
(pause_medium) That being a (pause_medium)
Being a (pause_short) complaint while you were doing your (vocal_noises_inhalation) martial arts stuff
(pause_short) few years ag o and
(pause_short) there were some times I came down on it
and it did some (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But that was (pause_short) impact injury
(pause_medium) Let's see (pause_short) how rough that is
(pause_short) Alright now straighten your knee out
(pause_short) Yeah
you've got a little (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Put your (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_short) it's
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)
hold your (pause_short) leg real strong there
(pause_medium) a pretty good muscle there
(pause_medium) Is that hurting anything
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
well I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) You know I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) probably
(pause_medium) it's mostly posterior cruciate
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (um)
(pause_medium) the medial collateral ligament
that (pause_short) ligament here is just minimally hurt
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (uh)
I think some of that (pause_medium) posterior cruciate was probably already r there
because it really (pause_medium) doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) See the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) This is the one that pulls on that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) When I push back
(pause_medium) I'm pushing on it
(pause_medium) That's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And
(pause_medium) But see this one
(pause_medium) has been hurt
(pause_medium) That does hurt
y (pause_short) it it hurts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's why I'm thinking that (pause_short) posterior is probably
(pause_short) a lot of that's been there
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you may have hurt it a little bit more
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) and y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Both of em are a little
(vocal_noises_inhalation) both of em can probably heal up if you let em
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_short) No need for surgery to make it better
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) the
(pause_medium) the outcome will probably be
(pause_medium) pretty close to what you had before
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) but it's not (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) something
you'll just have to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Try to have to see how it plays out
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you can z (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You can overcome that a little bit
by getting your (pause_short) muscle (pause_short) in better shape
(pause_medium) (TSK) There are two things that stabilize your knee
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This is your knee brace
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In fact
all the sports players they (pause_medium)
that they (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they really (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) have to (pause_short) compensate with their muscle power
(vocal_noises_inhalation) S o right
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) you know just
(pause_medium) just
(pause_short) (uh)
or (vocal_noises_inhalation) what we call just those (pause_short) little short extensions
just (vocal_noises_inhalation) put a (pause_short) bolster under behind your leg right here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg
(pause_medium) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and keep working up on the weight
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) you wanna b (pause_medium)
You (pause_medium)
you can just (pause_short) lock your knee real stiff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you don't have to move it when you do that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) all kinda ways
So just whatever the day will al (pause_short) permit
and you got some time to do some (pause_medium) isometrics
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (pause_short) keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the (pause_short) plan
You know so (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_medium) Do you think I can go back to (pause_medium) aikido and stuff
(pause_short) Probably
(pause_medium) as long as it's not too (pause_short) too violent
(pause_short) You know it's more form and
(pause_medium) stuff or it's
It's about (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
ideally it's about (pause_short) blending
(pause_medium) It's about blending with the attack
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) There's a lot of rolls
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I guess if you got good at (pause_short) at doing it
where you didn't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I think
I think you'll (pause_short) you'll be able to see for yourself
(pause_medium) Because (pause_short) once you get your (pause_short) muscles strong
it'll be pretty obvious to you whether you (vocal_noises_inhalation) you have the type of control (pause_medium) to do that
(pause_medium) What do you think the lesson should be from this
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I guess the less (pause_medium)
W one lesson is I'll (pause_medium) probably shouldn't try skiing anymore
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
I (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
He (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) Cause I'm lucky it wasn't worse
When I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It was a pretty bad fall
the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know what grade but
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there was a (pause_short) turn in the wood (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I had been skiing for two and a half hours
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I got (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) carried away
She showed me how when you're (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) there was a turn and then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I (pause_medium)
And the (pause_short) skis don't (pause_short) snap off of course
(pause_medium) it stuck
You (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And I didn't know what I'd done
(pause_medium) I screamed and
I don't know (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) hobble (pause_medium) on the ski pole
(vocal_noises_laughter) Oh my God
and then we had to call the (uh)
s the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oreille
(pause_medium) Geez
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Hunh
(pause_short) I'm a little (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium)
and I was (pause_medium)
I've made it (pause_short) how many (pause_medium)
Ah that's (pause_medium) unlikely
(pause_short) I've (pause_medium)
(pause_short) No it's
(pause_medium) it looks pretty g ood
(pause_medium) Yeah
the pain would be (vocal_noises_inhalation) probably your first warning sign
(pause_short) You could start (pause_short) feeling some (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) change in the (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) the status quo
(pause_short) Changes
I still feel (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
It feels (pause_short) b (pause_short) pretty much like the other leg
(pause_short) That's great
(pause_short) Wonderful
(pause_medium) Great
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) Love it
(pause_medium) Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself
(pause_medium) it's a (pause_short) cheap lesson
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short)
(pause_medium) I'd say so
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
I (pause_medium)
I was out (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) We were out
and the kids were (pause_short) skiing
(pause_short) God that would sure WH be fun
(pause_medium) And then s
just barely my common sense (pause_short) won out
but you know I've had (pause_short) two discs taken out of my back
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't need to go (pause_short) flumpity bump down the hill
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) you just have to
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) It's tempting
till I fell (pause_medium)
It's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then I'd have to pay for it for the rest of my life
(pause_medium) Good to see you
(pause_medium) Come see me
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) let me know what you get into
(pause_short) I hope so
(pause_medium) I think it will
(pause_medium) See you
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Just (pause_short) let us know
(pause_medium) if you need anything
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm in the cafeteria
(pause_short) that was VOX just a little bit VOX too long man
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) ha lf hour break (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You stretched a fifteen minute break into a half hour break
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then he comes into the cafeteria
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I thought he was coming in to chase everybody away
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he's coming after me
(pause_short) And he calls me
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he goes
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I go
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And on my production card
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Let's see
(pause_medium) The day before yesterday
(pause_short) I did ice cream
(pause_short) Right
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you gotta pack those in cases
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know man
(pause_medium) I packed two pallets
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) I don't know how many (pause_short) cases that is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(pause_short) that shit was heavy man
(pause_medium) and like
(pause_medium) I put down on the card
(pause_medium) you know we
(H) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
I w (pause_medium)
(uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Gutierrez was doing the (pause_short) same job
(pause_short) N yeah
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he comes and says
(pause_medium) if you've
(vocal_noises_inhalation) packed this or not
(pause_medium) You know
(pause_medium) On your production card
is that you did (pause_medium) three thousand sheets
but you did (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But you didn't pack it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I go
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) stamped right on there
(pause_medium) VOX Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he goes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm just going
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is the pits man
This is at the bottom of the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) This fucking mayate
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter) It's nothing new (vocal_noises_laughter)
it's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's p ar for the course man
(pause_medium) Right
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Ts why I can't take that
(uh)
(pause_short) career doesn't work out for me
I'm (pause_medium)
I'll be studying and (uh)
(pause_medium) but in a sense
I need (uh)
(pause_medium) some type of steady income
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
but (uh)
(pause_short) you s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) is it real tough
(pause_short) on the lot
(pause_medium) Yeah
There's def (pause_medium)
and they know how to (pause_short) talk to the people
(pause_short) when somebody's coming in
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) and they're pretty helpful with me
and (uh)
(pause_medium) you know it'll all come in time
(pause_medium) the more cards I get out
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) def inite (pause_medium)
I think s (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) It's gonna be the fifteenth

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And of course
(pause_short) the stuff that we put up
(pause_medium) wasn't first quality
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so everything they touched

H (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You have oil heat in your house
(pause_medium) Forced hot air
(pause_short) Yeah

(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) hook that right into the (pause_medium) central air
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yesterday
(pause_medium) at the coffee shop
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he said
he's been f (pause_short) fielding calls all week from neighbors
(pause_medium) Who would love to have their house done
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) but it's a matter of
(pause_medium) point two decibels
(pause_medium) The people
(pause_medium) dir (pause_medium) directly
(pause_medium) across the street (pause_short) diagonally from me
(pause_medium) Couldn't get it done because
(pause_medium) their
(pause_medium) decibel level
(pause_short) Wow
(pause_short) So it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And he said there's nothing you can do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's FDA
(pause_medium) that
(pause_medium) one is danger (pause_medium)
(pause_short) is (pause_medium) hazardous
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) And the other isn't
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and if they start (pause_medium) changing their regulations
(pause_medium) People who
(pause_medium) had theirs done three years ago
(pause_medium) and their neighbors across the street couldn't
the neighbors across the (vocal_noises_laughter) street are gonna be (vocal_noises_laughter) coming after them
(pause_short) You know
(pause_short) So

(vocal_noises_inhalation) all of my immediate neighbors had it done
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Oh

(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) Why they would refuse

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) That or they like the house the way it is

(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he took it off that and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he got his finances back in order

(pause_medium) all the people that had rented his house
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he said Section eight
(pause_medium) That (uh)
(pause_medium) But on this other program (vocal_noises_exhalation)

T (uh)
(pause_medium) during last (uh) August to September
(pause_medium) okay
and (uh)
(pause_short) just tell me about how you arrived at (uh) this claim
(pause_medium) Uh I was called by (pause_medium) Matthew here
(pause_medium) to do the job for him
(pause_short) Okay
you run a (pause_medium)
you run a (pause_short) a carpet business I presume
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) I went and estimated the job for myself
(pause_medium) for what he wanted to pay for it
(pause_medium) and I let him know that I could not
(pause_medium) Do the job
(pause_medium) I wouldn't make any money
(pause_medium) So (uh)
(pause_medium) upon me (pause_short) telling him that
(pause_medium) he offered
(pause_medium) to pay (pause_medium) my employees
(pause_medium) fill out
(pause_medium) and he paid him
(pause_medium) so that I in turn would make more money off the job
(pause_medium) I agreed to that
(pause_medium) after about (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Ca (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) is that a normal procedure XX
(pause_medium) He wanted me to do the job
(pause_medium) so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back
(pause_medium) so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on
(pause_short) So in other words
your (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So then your costs would be reduced there as far as
(pause_short) That's correc t
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) I went to receive my check
(pause_medium) of which
(pause_medium) we had agreed
(pause_short) that he would deduct
(pause_medium) the amount (pause_medium) of (pause_short) the hourly wage
(pause_medium) that he was (pause_medium)
or verbal (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Completely verbal
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_short) upon a reve (uh) (pause_medium)
(uh) (pause_medium) receiving my check
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) for about (pause_medium) two and a half weeks of work
(pause_medium) approximately between fifty and seventy hours
(pause_medium) So I approached him with it
(pause_medium) and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here
(pause_medium) and noted that
(pause_medium) what the employees made
(pause_medium) and (uh)
(pause_medium) at twenty six percent less deduction on these two employees
(pause_medium) Which was the employer contribution
(pause_medium) So I noted to him that he was supposed to pay that
(pause_medium) he said
(uh) n
(pause_medium) no
(pause_medium) you're gonna pay it
(pause_medium) So I said that's not (pause_medium) as per our agreement
(pause_medium) And he's there to state
(pause_short) he's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) he saw that
and was (pause_short) witness to that
(pause_medium) I have a letter
(pause_short) But
(pause_medium) that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) finally I (uh) (pause_short) contacted my attorney
(pause_medium) I'd like to present this letter to you here
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) have you shown that to (uh) Mister Collins
He has (pause_medium)
(pause_short) he has (pause_medium) received (pause_medium) a copy of that letter
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Now Stu Roberts is an attorney
(pause_short) Yes sir
(pause_medium) You're (uh)
(pause_medium) I'm his nephew
(pause_medium) And you're Nick Ro (pause_short) Roberts' nephew too then
(pause_medium) That's correct
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) So (uh) your uncle then wrote (uh) Builders (uh) a letter
(pause_medium) Yes sir
(pause_medium) Uh I do emphasize that I'm reading it
tha t you've told (pause_medium) Mister Roberts
(pause_medium) That's correct
(pause_medium) (TSK) So really the dispute then boils down to this twenty six percent
(pause_short) That's it sir
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) That's the reason why I had him (pause_medium) fill out that portion of
or he (pause_medium) wanted to (pause_medium) write those checks
(pause_short) Was so I would save that money
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) Mister Collins I know you're
(pause_medium) biting at the bit there
you wanna (vocal_noises_exhalation) say something
(pause_short) Okay thank you your honor
(pause_medium) Um

(pause_medium) (uh) did do some work for me out at the college
(pause_medium) And this is a
(pause_medium) eight thousand yard job
(pause_short) that we did this summer
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It required us to
(pause_medium) employ
(pause_medium) oh five or six crews
(pause_medium) (uh) Mitchell Roberts was one of them that we used
(pause_medium) Uh Mitchell (pause_medium) expressed a desire to do the work out there
(pause_medium) he expressed
(pause_medium) he did not know how to handle the payroll
(pause_medium) Most of the (pause_medium) (uh) contractors here in town
(pause_medium) don't know how to do prevailing wage statements
(pause_short) The college is a (pause_medium) state funded (uh) (pause_medium) (uh) (pause_medium) remodel
(pause_medium) and on state funded remodels
(pause_medium) to pay prevailing wages
(pause_medium) Uh prevailing wages
(pause_short) that
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) that indicate different (pause_medium) levels of agility
(pause_medium) of the different men working
(pause_medium) And so
(pause_short) (uh) a lot of the crews
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) like Mitchell
(pause_short) who have (pause_short) people that work (pause_medium) under him
(pause_short) around town
in (pause_short) regular situations
(pause_medium) come to the people like me
(pause_medium) When we do the payroll for them
(pause_medium) we state to them up front
(pause_medium) that (pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) we will make the deductions
(pause_medium) and then (pause_short) the employer contribution
(pause_medium) which is approximately twenty six percent
(pause_medium) over and above (pause_medium) the hourly wage
(pause_medium) is also deducted
(pause_medium) from (pause_short) the (pause_short) (um) (pause_medium) subcontractor's check
(pause_short) Now this (uh) (pause_short) th twenty six percent
that'd be (pause_short) be social security
(pause_medium) Um (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Sorta like (um)
(pause_medium) Th at's anything above that
Well you have (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) XXX
(pause_medium) you have that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I have a breakdown here
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) I mean
do (pause_medium)
y you got a total of (uh)
(pause_medium) seven point six five percent employer contributions on the
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) that explains it pretty well
(pause_short) of course (pause_medium)
(pause_medium)
Oh and and the oh the (pause_medium)
the f (pause_medium)
and (uh)
F UDA (pause_short) FICA
(pause_medium) Now that's
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) in any payroll deduction situation
(pause_medium) the employee contribution
(pause_medium) which is deducted from the employee's (pause_medium) wages
(pause_short) and then you have the employer's (pause_medium) contribution
(pause_medium) Which the employer has to pay
(pause_medium) Now the agreement that we had made
(pause_medium) with all of the (pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) subcontractors
(uh)
(pause_medium) Mark Preston's sitting here
(pause_medium) which is testifying for Mitch Roberts
(pause_medium) also did work for me
(pause_medium) and he was treated the same way
We (pause_short) paid him
(pause_medium) we took his deductions out
(pause_medium) as well as (pause_medium) that
(pause_medium) and
(uh) did that
(pause_medium) with everybody
(pause_medium) Okay wai (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) That would be fine if that was the agreement
Now you say that the w (pause_medium)
you under (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Uh yes sir
(pause_short) Before he went to work
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Absolute ly not
(pause_medium) The reason
(pause_medium) and I stress this
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) my (pause_medium) total
I agree (pause_medium)
with (pause_medium) withholding and every thing
R ight I'm (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That was fine
(pause_medium) It really boils down
But (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) The dis cussion
(pause_medium) So that I wouldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So that I wouldn't end up making
(pause_medium) I have my own payroll service
and they're very familiar with all (pause_medium) types of pay
(pause_medium) This is why I didn't wanna take the job to begin with
(pause_medium) Uh I can u (pause_medium)
He in turn (pause_medium)
(pause_short) now
(pause_short) Mister Collins says
(pause_medium) he denies that you said
(pause_medium) everything
He just (pause_medium)
I wouldn't 've (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You have a different (pause_short) story
on what (pause_short) the agreement was
(pause_short) Right
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) (uh) Karen here
(pause_medium) (uh)
and (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) she's here to testify about a conversation
(pause_medium) that (pause_short) her and Mitchell had
and I'd like to (pause_medium)
(pause_short) After the agreement was entered into
(pause_medium) he had been on the job for about a week or so
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) I believe for the
(pause_medium) first or second pay (pause_medium) period for his men
(pause_medium) Uh he came into the office
(pause_medium) about
(pause_medium) A the payroll
(pause_medium) and B this twenty six percent that we're talking about
And she'd be hap py to tell you (pause_medium)
(pause_short) why don't you please
(pause_short) explain the conversation you had with Mister Roberts
(pause_medium) Okay
he was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) we were going over the wages for Phil Nigel
(pause_short) who was one of the (pause_short) gentlemen on there
(pause_medium) as to (pause_short) how much (pause_short) Phil was to get
(pause_medium) for the job
(pause_short) On an hourly basis
(pause_medium) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I said okay
I take out (pause_medium) this amount
(pause_medium) from your check
(pause_medium) And he goes oh
Well then (pause_short) no
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So we were going back and forth with the figures
(pause_medium) this is (pause_short) the
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) wage that we came up with
(pause_medium) And then have seventeen dollars (pause_short) an hour
taken out of Mitch (pause_medium) 's check
(pause_medium) Mitch Roberts' check
(pause_medium) And this is the (vocal_noises_inhalation) note that I'd written down on that
(pause_medium) you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty six percent
(vocal_noises_inhalation) would actually equal to seventeen o one
(pause_short) You know
(pause_medium) just the seventeen was fine
Oh this (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) So
I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I had that perfect conversation with her
(pause_short) And that's very true
(pause_medium) But she never told me anything about
(pause_medium) this twenty six percent
(pause_medium) Why (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It's (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) go ahead
(pause_medium) I was offered
and Matthew (vocal_noises_inhalation) offered me the same (pause_medium) situation
(pause_medium) And it was my understanding
(pause_medium) that he was to pay (pause_medium) everything
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) supply (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and pay all of the employer's stuff
(pause_medium) If you're an employer
(pause_short) You gotta pay all the extra thing s
you don't have any (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) y you can't testify
(pause_medium) Mitch was mak (pause_medium)
M and (pause_medium)
he just mentioned that he (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check
(pause_medium) MRC He did not MRC
(pause_short) Prevailing wages
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I saw the people's checks
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) I'm just drawing a pi
(pause_medium) H Ma Mister Collins was supposed to pay (pause_medium) everything
(pause_medium) He approached him with the same
Fir f f (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he d (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Who're all licensed contractors
(pause_medium) But I still (pause_medium)
I still don't know (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it would be
(pause_medium) if it may please you
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_short) the whole reason why I'm here
(pause_medium) Is because he took that twenty six percent out
(pause_medium) he used it as
(pause_short) more or less bait me to do the job
(pause_medium) and went ahead and withheld it from me
(pause_medium) Without saying a word to it
(pause_short) I was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) when he wrote my check
(pause_medium) He wrote my check to me
(pause_medium) handed it to me through a window
(pause_medium) says that's the way it is
(pause_medium) and th (pause_medium)
and and you know (pause_medium)
it wasn't (pause_medium)
and he (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) totally evaded me
(pause_short) he has to this day evaded me
(pause_short) Mister Roberts
(pause_short) That's beside the point
What I'm trying to (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) We have to really hone in on
If he (pause_medium)
(pause_short) That
(pause_short) You know
I don't care if he folded an airplane and ma (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Everything
But he di (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) WH Okay WH
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) you've gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence
(pause_medium) Well then if (pause_medium)
More (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Now you say one thing
(pause_medium) Then (pause_medium)
when when a person (pause_short) fills out
(pause_medium) why would I become liable
(pause_medium) for that contribution
When h (pause_short) when he in fact by law
(pause_medium) He's the employer
(pause_medium) I am doing nothing
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Isn't there a law that states that fact
(pause_medium) When you have
(pause_medium) (uh) people
(pause_medium) work for you
(pause_medium) stating that
Wh (pause_medium)
what were the (pause_medium)
Go go through the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) y conversation as you saw it
(pause_medium) Conversation was
(pause_medium) I'll go ahead and pay all your employees
(pause_medium) That was pretty much it
(pause_medium) That's it
(pause_medium) That's to the point
(pause_medium) And he did sir
(pause_medium) And then when it came to the employer contribution
(pause_medium) without my knowledge or anything
(pause_medium) he just yanked that right out of my check
(pause_medium) And Mister Collins (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) that conv (pause_medium)
tell me about the conversation (pause_short) you believe (pause_short) happened
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) um
(pause_medium) Mitch and I
(pause_short) um
(pause_medium) but he wanted to do the work under the basis that I paid his men
(pause_medium) and I told him about
(pause_medium) what I said earlier here
(pause_short) About the twenty six percent
(pause_medium) and (pause_short) at (pause_short) (uh)
(pause_medium) He was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (uh) made aware of
(pause_medium) the (uh)
(pause_medium) were made by the employer
(pause_short) and we were doing a service for him
(pause_medium) under this agreement that we had between us
(pause_short) Now just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) just seems from a logical standpoint
(pause_medium) That's cor rect
Would you (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Why would he do the work
(pause_medium) So you would trick me into doing it
(pause_medium) Tho (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
with all my (pause_medium)
(pause_short) with my (pause_short) fourteen years experience
Why would I do that amount (pause_short) amount of work
(pause_medium) Well I XX (pause_medium)
so I (pause_medium)
(uh) I don't (pause_medium)
Well tha t's not (pause_medium)
That's why I turned the d (pause_short) the job down to begin with
(pause_medium) Well
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) if Mister Roberts' testimony is correct he should win
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now (pause_medium)
(pause_short) for this amount of money
(pause_medium) That's why I turned the job down to begin with
(pause_medium) That's why I'm here in the court today
to make (pause_short) the court decide
(pause_medium) It shouldn't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It shouldn't be legal for guys to do this
Well I'm gonna make (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(uh)
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) I wasn't there
(pause_medium) But
I'm the one that's bearing the burden of this (pause_short) monetary amount
(pause_medium) I understand that
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I'm gonna award
(pause_medium) Mister Roberts
(pause_medium) three hundred fifty dollars
(pause_medium) Approximately half
(pause_medium) Now Mister Collins may not like that
(pause_medium) now y (pause_medium)
(pause_short) if he doesn't like it
(pause_medium) Running the risk that he might face
(pause_medium) the full amount of seven hundred and four dollar s
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) But I'm going to get it (pause_medium)
and (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) award mister Roberts
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) three hundred and fifty dollars
(pause_medium) and if neither party is happy
(pause_short) both parties are unhappy
(pause_medium) So
(pause_medium) Thank you your honor
Make it for the (uh)
(pause_medium) plaintiff of thr ee fifty
(pause_medium) Thank you your honor
(pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) any of you who find that you really enjoy storytelling
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In Spring Grove Illinois

(pause_medium) I know you have
(pause_medium) Alright
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) had attended your church a number of times
(pause_short) (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) from the (pause_short) Illinois storytelling festival
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(pause_short) we would love to have you all come
(pause_short) There are four tents
(vocal_noises_inhalation) an adult tent
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a general tent
and then a (pause_short) traditions tent
(vocal_noises_inhalation) world war whatever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) f first time you ever rode in a train
(pause_short) all of those things
(pause_short) And I hope that some of you would be able to come
(pause_medium) (COUGH COUGH)
(pause_medium) The next story that I have
(pause_short) the Native Americans
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's called how the stars got in the sky
(pause_medium) Did you ever wonder how the stars got in the sky
(pause_medium) This is the way the Indians think that the stars got in the sky
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I learned this story
(pause_medium) a white man
In (pause_short) Wisconsin
(pause_medium) he has (pause_short) taken on all of the Native American ways
(pause_medium) (uh)
(pause_medium) And he gave me permission to tell the story
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Long ago
(pause_medium) in the sky there was only the sun and the moon
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And on the nights
(pause_short) when the moon didn't shine
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well all of the animals got together
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and decided they were going to go to the creator
(pause_medium) To see if he could help with the problem
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_medium) I will help you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) All of you are to go down to the lake
(pause_short) And gather stones
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now not round stones
(pause_medium) but jagged stones
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And when you have got as many as you can carry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) bring them to me
(pause_medium) And so
(pause_medium) all the animals went (pause_short) to the lake
(pause_medium) All except (pause_short) coyote
(pause_medium) Because L coyote was laz y L
And he was (pause_short) asleep
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And the little animals like grasshopper and bumblebee
(pause_medium) they could only carry one
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But they all brought them to the feet of the creator
(pause_medium) L All except (pause_short) coyote
(pause_medium) he was lazy and
he was (pause_medium) asleep L
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So the creator looked over all the stones that were brought
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and chose one
(pause_short) Not too large
(THROAT)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and reached up
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and placed it in the sky
(pause_medium) And when he did
(pause_short) it began to twinkle
(pause_medium) And he said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) this I will call a star
(pause_medium) And this one a special star
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The North Star
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And this evening
(pause_short) are going to go
(pause_medium) off the edge of the Earth
(pause_medium) into the sky
(pause_medium) With stars
(pause_medium) And so
(pause_medium) that evening
(pause_medium) all of the animals
(pause_medium) and they MRC walked off the edge of the world MRC
(pause_medium) Into the sky
(pause_medium) To make their pictures
(vocal_noises_inhalation) With the brilliant dots
(pause_medium) that would turn into stars
(pause_medium) They all went except (pause_medium) coyote
(TSK) (pause_medium) Because he was lazy
(pause_medium) And he was (pause_medium) asleep
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well after all the animals had gone
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the creator call ed to coyote
(pause_medium) come on now
(pause_medium) Time (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And coyote
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX he yawned and VOX (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he got up
and he (pause_medium) VOX dragged himself to the presence of the creator VOX
(pause_medium) and said VOX ye yes
(pause_medium) what (pause_medium) do you need me to do VOX
(pause_medium) And the creator said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But some of them can't carry very many stones
(pause_medium) I want you to take this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) VOX this great big bag of stones into the sky VOX
(pause_medium) then you give them the extras that they need
(pause_medium) (COUGH)
(pause_short) L Well
(pause_medium) And he took one look at that bag and thought
(pause_medium) I don't wanna do that VOX
(pause_medium) But you don't argue with the creator
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) And so
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) got up and he
(pause_short) took that heavy bag and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) put it on his back and
he w alked off (pause_medium) the edge of the Earth
(pause_medium) Into the sky
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well he hadn't gone very far
when that bag started to feel (pause_short) very (pause_short) heavy
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And so he looked one way
(pause_short) (THROAT)
(pause_short) and then he looked the other
(pause_medium) and he put that big bag down
(pause_medium) VOX and then he VOX dug both paws in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and threw a whole bunch of stones behind him one way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and a whole bunch the other way
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and then he picked that bag up
(pause_medium) put it on his back again
(pause_medium) Well it wasn't so heavy now
(pause_medium) So he walked a little further
(pause_medium) and a little further
(pause_medium) And he looked one way
(pause_medium) And he looked the other way
(pause_medium) And then he put that bag down
(pause_medium) VOX and he VOX dug in again
(pause_medium) Flung one paw full of stones one way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) one the other way
(pause_medium) and no one had seen him
(pause_medium) But the sky was getting brighter behind him
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He put that bag right up back on his back
(pause_medium) walked a little further
(pause_medium) Well it felt good for about a minute or two
(pause_medium) he just couldn't stand it anymore
(pause_medium) L He looked one way
(pause_medium) he looked the other L
(pause_medium) then he put that bag down
(pause_short) opened it real wide
(pause_medium) and like a puppy (pause_short) digging a hole
(pause_short) he just dug
(vocal_noises_inhalation) right out of that bag
(pause_medium) And all those stones
(vocal_noises_inhalation) started sparkling behind him
(pause_medium) Then he took that bag
(pause_medium) made sure it was empty
(pause_short) folded it up
(pause_medium) made a little pillow
(pause_short) pulled up a comfortable cloud
(pause_medium) laid down
(pause_medium) and went to sleep
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) VOX coyote
(pause_medium) right over (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) coyote didn't hear them
(pause_medium) Because he was lazy
(pause_medium) and he was
(pause_medium) asleep
(pause_medium) WH Well WH
(pause_medium) the first rays of morning
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and all the animals had to scurry
(pause_medium) back onto the Earth
(pause_medium) Some of them had to leave their pictures
(pause_medium) half done
(pause_medium) Some had only had one stone
(pause_short) They could just (pause_medium) put up in the sky
(vocal_noises_inhalation) A few were finished
(pause_medium) and finally when a ray of light hit coyote in the eye
(pause_medium) he woke up and
(pause_short) he realized
(pause_medium) So he did
(pause_medium) But that night
(pause_medium) MRC when he looked up at the sky MRC
(pause_medium) that's when he learned how to howl
(pause_medium) Because he saw L all the other animals with their pictures in the sky L
(pause_medium) and MRC his wasn't there MRC
(pause_medium) Because he'd been lazy
(pause_medium) And he had been (pause_short) asleep
(pause_medium) And that's the story
(pause_medium) of how all the stars got in the sky
(pause_medium) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_short) Some of my favorite kinds of stories
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) A nd this is a story that has a tiger
(pause_medium) And I need you to be the tiger
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now this tiger keeps changing his mind about things
(vocal_noises_inhalation) sometimes you're going to say
(pause_medium) that's good said tiger
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(pause_medium) that tiger changes his mind
(pause_medium) And he says
(pause_medium) that's bad said tiger
(pause_medium) That's bad says tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) what keeps flipping this tiger back and forth
(pause_medium) L Boy was sitting on a big rock L
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In the middle of the jungle
(pause_medium) Just sitting
(pause_medium) When along (pause_medium) came (pause_medium) tiger
(pause_medium) VOX Run boy VOX

(pause_medium) Tell me why you won't run
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then I will eat you VOX
(pause_medium) Said tiger
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well it's like this said the boy
(pause_medium) I was walking
(pause_medium) Just walking in the jungle when
(pause_short) ((SLAP)) (pause_medium) I bumped into rhino
(pause_medium) PAR You know what a rhino is
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) A great (pause_medium) big (pause_short) animal with a horn
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Or rhino bumped into me
(pause_medium) I was willing to forget it
(pause_medium) But not rhino
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So he got mad
(pause_medium) Now this is where you say
(pause_medium) that's good said tiger
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I ran

(pause_short) boy can he run fast
(pause_medium) That's bad said tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well I ran and I ran and I ran and I ran
(pause_medium) And I climbed up in that tree
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I sat on a branch
(pause_medium) and rhino
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he ran right under me
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's good said tiger
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) L he came back (pause_short) looking for me L
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) That's bad said tiger
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So I got down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I threw it at rhino to scare him away
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But
(pause_short) L it didn't scare him away L
(pause_short) Tha t's bad said tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I got down
(pause_medium) A little slower now
(pause_short) (PFEW)
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(pause_medium) And then
(pause_medium) then
(pause_medium) right in front of rhino
(pause_medium) That's bad said tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but rhino was going so fast this time
(pause_short) he ran right (vocal_noises_inhalation) over me
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But I got up
(pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) there was rhino
Right there (pause_medium) back again
(pause_medium) That's bad said tiger
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So I ran and I ran
(vocal_noises_inhalation) until I saw (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) a vine
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I grabbed the vine
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(pause_medium) But on the other side
(pause_medium) was crocodile
(pause_medium) With his mouth (pause_short) wide open
(pause_medium) That's bad said tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I swang back
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I let go of the vine
(pause_medium) and I didn't see rhino anywhere
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I got down
(pause_medium) and then I realized
(pause_medium) I had been (pause_medium) on (pause_short) rhino's (pause_short) back
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Tha (pause_medium)
Tha (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) So I got behind a tree
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I picked up another stone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) rhino can't see very well
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but he heard that stone
(pause_medium) That's good said tiger
(pause_medium) And then tiger said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And so then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you (pause_short) ran away
(pause_medium) And boy said
(pause_medium) L well
(pause_short) No
(pause_medium) I (pause_short) was so tired
I (pause_short) just sat down (pause_medium) here
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and now I'm going to get behind this big stone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) here comes rhino now L
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) got up
(pause_short) P not tired anymore P
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he ran away home
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) P And that's good
(pause_medium) that's bad
(pause_medium) Now I know storytelling is a new thing for a lot of you
but it (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_short) if you do have enjoyment of it
at (pause_short) at the storytelling festival
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I have one more story for you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) How many of you already know the story the frog prince
(pause_medium) The frog prince
(pause_medium) the prince who is
(pause_medium) turned into a frog by a witch
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(LAUGHTER)
I h (pause_medium)
and then in order to (pause_short) regain his form
(pause_medium) be kissed by a beautiful princess
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
this is the story (pause_short) of the other (pause_medium) frog (pause_medium) prince
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) It was a beautiful day at the pond
(pause_medium) But the frog prince
(pause_medium) who was sitting (pause_medium) on his lily pad in the middle of the pond
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) was he lonely
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean the MRC birds were flying above him
(pause_medium) the fish were swimming below him
(pause_medium) but no one was paying a bit of attention to him MRC
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX When VOX
(pause_medium) who should he see
(pause_medium) walking along the path with a book under her arm
(pause_medium) but L the most beautiful princess he had ever seen L
(pause_medium) VOX Well (uh)
(pause_medium) finally a little company VOX
(pause_medium) He said to himself
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) And he took off his little gold crown
(pause_medium) put it next to him on the lily pad
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) hopped into the water
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and swam across
(pause_short) poking his little head up (pause_short) through the reeds
(pause_medium) VOX Oh (uh)
(pause_medium) pardon me
(pause_short) Beautiful princess VOX
(pause_medium) he said in his most pitiful (pause_short) and pathetic voice
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX But (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) if you could help me VOX
(pause_medium) Well
the princess was quite surprised to be spoken to by (pause_short) a frog
(pause_medium) but she felt so sorry for his pitiful (pause_medium) and pathetic voice
(pause_medium) that she said
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) VOX Why
(pause_medium) you dear little frog
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Whatever can I can I do to help you VOX
(pause_medium) And he said
(pause_medium) VOX Oh
(pause_medium) well you see
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I am not really a frog
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I am really a handsome prince
(pause_medium) Who has been turned into a frog by
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the spell of a wicked witch
(pause_medium) And in order to break the spell
(pause_medium) I must be kissed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) by
(pause_medium) a beautiful princess VOX
(pause_medium) Well
(pause_short) L somehow the princess
(pause_short) had the feeling that he was gonna say that L
and felt (pause_medium) so sorry for him L
(pause_medium) and she thought
(pause_medium) VOX Well
(pause_medium) What do I have to lose VOX
(pause_medium) VOX And so VOX
(pause_medium) she reached down
(pause_medium) And she picked him up
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and she brought him MRC right up close to her face MRC
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and she closed her eye s
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she gave him
(pause_medium) a great (pause_short) big (pause_short) kiss
(pause_medium) Do you wanna help me make kiss sounds
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) (KISS)
(KISS)
(pause_medium) But when she opened her eyes
(pause_medium) She was surprised to see
(pause_medium) the frog
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) With a great big smile
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) And he said
(pause_medium) VOX nice kiss sweetie
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I was just kidding about the prince part
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) and he hopped into the water
(pause_medium) And she (pause_medium) wiped (pause_short) the frog slime
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) VOX Ugh VOX
(pause_medium) And that's the story of the other frog prince
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) there are (pause_medium) a couple of other storytelling events
(pause_medium) that I'd just like to share with you
(pause_medium) one is in Elgin tomorrow evening
(um)
(pause_short) doing some (pause_short) stories
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)

(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh) next Saturday

(pause_medium) So I thank you (pause_medium) very much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) any other group you might belong to
(pause_medium) Thank you very much
((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) What a great audience
(pause_medium) Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) It's (uh)
(pause_medium) truly a historic occasion (pause_medium) today
(pause_medium) to have (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) among us
(pause_medium) a citizen who has contributed so much
(pause_medium) not only to this (pause_short) entire area
(pause_medium) but t to the world of ceramics
(pause_medium) and also to the world of literature
(pause_medium) and been part (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
of one of the great (pause_short) artistic movements
(pause_medium) which (pause_short) revolutionized
(pause_medium) the way (pause_medium) art was considered
(pause_medium) and which today still has
(pause_medium) extraordinary resonance
(pause_medium) in the work (pause_medium) of younger artists
(pause_medium) who are (pause_short) rediscovering
(pause_medium) something that was discovered
(pause_medium) at the v (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and with which (pause_short) Miss Wood
(pause_medium) was so intimately involved
(pause_medium) P XXX P
(pause_medium) To have (pause_short) the Mother (pause_short) of Dada (pause_short) w ith us
(vocal_noises_laughter)
((LAUGHTER_AND_APPLAUSE))
is in (pause_short) deed a pleasure
I would like to (pause_short) hold forth
but (pause_short) I don't think I'm going to be allowed to
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
Beatrice (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) it is yours (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) my voice alright
(pause_medium) ((MURMURS_AND_APPLAUSE))
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) just mentioned
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) It all (pause_medium) touched me
(pause_medium) by the name (pause_medium) no
No is the most dangerous (vocal_noises_inhalation) word (vocal_noises_inhalation) in the English language
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
(pause_short) it has absolutely (pause_short) changed my life
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) For instance
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I was brought up
(pause_medium) very carefully
(pause_medium) I was a good little girl
(pause_medium) And I was in great revolt
(pause_medium) My mother saw that I had a governess
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that I went to private schools
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I was in (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I didn't like this at all
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) one day
(pause_medium) I met Elisa
(pause_medium) A journalist
(vocal_noises_inhalation) She knew writers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she lived a bohemian life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I was very (pause_short) attracted
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I invited her (pause_medium) to home
(pause_short) for luncheon
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) After she left
(pause_medium) VOX she's common VOX
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
Th at (pause_short) hurt me
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) That was first (pause_short) no
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Alright
(pause_medium) I went to see her
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) she had a little apartment in Greenwich Village
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's a (pause_short) young musician
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Who's broken his leg
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you speak French
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and it was (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Varese
the musician of the avant garde (vocal_noises_inhalation) music
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Marcel (pause_short) Duchamp (pause_short) was there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The great painter
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) of The Nude Descending the Staircase
(pause_medium) Alright
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Marcel Duchamp
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Roche was a (pause_short) collector (pause_short) of art
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and (pause_short) a diplomat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) sent by the French government
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he called on my parents twice
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and after he left
(pause_short) my mother said
(pause_medium) VOX you're in love with that man
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_short) That was her (pause_medium) second (pause_short) no
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I said
oh (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'll come to see you
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's nothing at all
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't mind
(vocal_noises_inhalation) no no no
it's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's not (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I said look
(pause_short) I'm (pause_short) shopping just around the corner
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(LAUGHTER)
I (um)
(pause_medium) m (pause_medium) decided
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I entered his (pause_short) very simple little room
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I remembered there were very coarse curtains
and the (vocal_noises_inhalation) sun shone through them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) made them like gold
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I stood in his room
(pause_medium) and he was very nice gentlemanly man
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he didn't quite know what to do
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and he stood opposite me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And
I saw a painting on his (pause_short) wall
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a (pause_short) glass of water on the table
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and
(pause_medium) he wasn't saying anything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) So
finally I (pause_short) looked at him
(pause_medium) VOX aren't you going to show me your (pause_short) etchings VOX
I was never (vocal_noises_inhalation) a good little girl
((LAUGHTER_AND_APPLAUSE))
it was the kind of life (vocal_noises_inhalation) I wanted
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He
(pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)(vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) he (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I met all the great artists of that day
and had a wonderful (vocal_noises_inhalation) time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was just I think twenty two
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so
(pause_short) I was of age
(LAUGHTER)
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_medium) I'm very (pause_short) international
(pause_medium) in feeling
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I've traveled quite a good deal
(pause_short) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) people (pause_medium) are the same (pause_short) everywhere
of having (pause_short) this feeling for the whole world
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I love that I'm a Californian
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I (pause_medium)
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and one of the reasons I love California so much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) is
(pause_short) that it's kinky
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_medium)
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) come up because it's kinky
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) it's just wonderful
the (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) marvelous new ideas that come up
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And of course
what I (pause_medium) like about (pause_medium) America
(pause_medium) because
in spite of being (pause_medium) very international in my feeling
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I think ours
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We're quick in friendship
We are (pause_medium) open to new ideas
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We (pause_short) made
we presented many (pause_short) new inventions
(pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) and this is very serious
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Our
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) athletes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) our actors (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And our teachers
(pause_short) are being cut down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And our libraries (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) MRC This is very very serious MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's putting a block (pause_medium) on knowledge
(vocal_noises_inhalation) China
and other Middle East country (pause_medium)
Not (vocal_noises_inhalation) other Middle East but (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) Middle East countries and China
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and other countries (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) are realizing the importance of education
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And going after it
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we
(pause_short) are cutting down
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it worries me a great deal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) One of the wonders of America
(pause_short) (TSK) however
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (TSK) in spite of the bad things
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) several years ago
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) who taught ceramics
(pause_medium) I think at Mills College
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) went to Europe
(pause_medium) To learn
(vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC Europe shares nothing MRC
(pause_medium) America shares
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And because America shares (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Has grown so wonderfully
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) We're doing wonderfully inventive things in craft
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but
I've had (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) four (pause_short) very wonderful craftsmen
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to help me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) Lukens at USC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the Natzlers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when they first came to America
(vocal_noises_inhalation) would sit by me at the wheel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and help me (pause_short) try
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to see what throwing was about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they've been so generous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they pass down everything
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and (uh)
(pause_medium) I remember Toshiko (vocal_noises_inhalation) Takaezu
(vocal_noises_inhalation) was visiting me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she spent a day and a half helping me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) center on the wheel
(vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC All this sharing MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) In our schools
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Is a wonderful thing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So the movements go on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And of course (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) our museums (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) Are so (pause_short) important
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
(pause_medium) if military (pause_medium) minded people
(pause_medium) PAR hope nobody from the FBI is here PAR
if (uh)
(pause_short) the importance of museums
(vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC museums protect all the great art MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The great invention
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The creative efforts of man from the beginning of time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) they're our inspiration
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I think our museums are doing wonderfully now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we're beginning to cut down on education
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I (uh)
(pause_medium) I feel
(pause_medium) about the importance
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) of craft
(pause_medium) Of bringing (pause_medium) beauty
(pause_short) Craft into life
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) One day (pause_short) I said to Vivika Heino
(pause_medium) Because I'm a snob about art
(vocal_noises_inhalation) through the museums of Europe
and my eyes are exposed to (vocal_noises_inhalation) great art
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I said
(pause_medium) VOX you know VOX
(pause_medium) it's a mistake
(pause_medium) to teach
(pause_medium) (pause_short) cr (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) pottery
(pause_medium) in high school
(pause_medium) The students haven't time to make anything beautiful and important
(pause_medium) And Vivika Heino so wisely answered
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that is not the purpose
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It opens them
(pause_medium) To aesthetics
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's what right education does
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I wonder
(pause_medium) We have (pause_medium) a tremendous (pause_medium) population in prison
(pause_medium) And it's growing
we can hardly (pause_medium) house them
(pause_medium) Why
(pause_medium) We put the cart before the horse
(pause_medium) We put people in prison
(pause_short) Why
(pause_medium) Because they have MRC not had right education MRC in the beginning
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And right (pause_medium) education
is the basis (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) of everything
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now ha I'll (pause_short) end with one other (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) idea
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Since there is an Olympic (pause_short) of athletes
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Why not have an Olympic
(pause_medium) of ethnic and tribal dancers
(vocal_noises_inhalation) from (pause_short) countries all over the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then people could come
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and meet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) friendships would be made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(pause_medium) I don't think we can have peace
(pause_medium) just with guns
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Peace comes through friendship
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And friendships would be made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) with all these dancers intermingling
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And even dancing with each other
(pause_medium) Because
(pause_medium) when you touch
(pause_medium) you don't shoot
(pause_medium) (LAUGHTER)
(pause_short) And (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) I base this (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when I was in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh) (pause_short) (uh) Ojai
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would go dancing at the art center
(vocal_noises_inhalation) nobody cared
(pause_medium) who we were dancing with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) or
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a man taking care of trash
(pause_medium) nobody cared
(vocal_noises_inhalation) As long as he was a good dancer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And after
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we had a party
And (pause_short) all of us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) mixed together in friendship
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That (pause_short) is wonderful
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_inhalation) If we had great dances
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) I come back
my last (pause_medium) word is
(pause_medium) violence
(pause_short) never ends
(pause_medium) with violence
(pause_medium) And right education
(pause_medium) is the basis
(pause_short) of everything

after you (pause_short) broke away from her

(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) I broke away
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I wasn't really
(pause_short) too interested
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) But
(pause_medium) I thought it was the only way I could earn money
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I threatened my mother to run away
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so she said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you can study under the Comedie
(pause_short) Comedie Francaise
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Because she thought
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that if I (pause_short) acted in French
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it was safer
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_short) in America
(pause_medium) I
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) I was acting in the French theatre
(pause_medium) then I (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I spoke perfect French
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(pause_short) for two years
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I want to MRC act in English MRC
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And my good friend
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so many (pause_medium) people in the theatre
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I got many parts offered me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX No
(pause_medium) You get leading lady
(pause_medium) part of me was really
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a good little girl
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so I was very (pause_short) subdued
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) No
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You can't do that
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
(pause_medium) a woman came from Canada
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And said
(pause_medium) To Canada
(pause_medium) and act in the theatre there
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) On salary
(pause_medium) And I said yes
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) And that's
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when I broke
(pause_medium) with my home
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) had a nervous breakdown for two days
(pause_medium) VOX you're killing your mother VOX
(pause_medium) and I said
(pause_medium) VOX she's killing me VOX
(pause_medium) And I'm the younger
(pause_medium) ((APPLAUSE))
(pause_short) where I am
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) and very generous
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but she was in a way of thinking
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we didn't have radio
life wasn't (vocal_noises_inhalation) as open as it is now
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_short) would want
(pause_short) social life for their daughter
(pause_medium) Probably
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Now
(LAUGHTER)
(pause_medium) when she died
in (pause_short) thirty six
(pause_medium) I had left home then
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The last three months of her life we became friends
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she let go
(pause_short) Of all that kind of (pause_medium) thing
and she was very wonderful (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and open
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and the last day of her life
(vocal_noises_inhalation) conscious
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we joked about it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I understand there's a wonderful exhibition
(vocal_noises_inhalation) don't tell any of the others
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but go see it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she was just wonderful
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So I'm very happy to be say (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) To s (pause_short) be able to say
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we became friends
(pause_short) At the end
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Yes
(uh)
about your (pause_medium) thoughts on (uh)
(pause_short) bringing art to the prisons
(pause_medium) F Could you explain
about bringing (pause_short) art to the prisons (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) to the prisons F
(pause_medium) I think it'd be wonderful
(pause_medium) Uh
(pause_medium) I've always been
(pause_medium) concerned about people being (vocal_noises_inhalation) in prison
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) but I really don't know
(pause_medium) very much
(pause_medium) I just think it's a terrible thing
(pause_medium) That we have so many
(pause_medium) And I'm sure
(pause_medium) we could s
(pause_short) what is called save the lives
(pause_short) of endless people
if they had a creative (pause_medium) outlet
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But what is a (pause_medium) young person to do
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Brought up
(pause_medium) not knowing in any way right from wrong
(vocal_noises_inhalation) seeing bing bing bing
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) guns used all the time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) drugs
(pause_medium) why should they not steal
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) I don't know if this has any value
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) When I left home
(pause_short) in name only
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But the man
(vocal_noises_inhalation) MRC without any money MRC
(pause_medium) And I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I sold w my own books
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to get money to eat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to be
(pause_medium) I was not trained for the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I didn't know
(pause_short) how (pause_short) to relate (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) to the world
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and
they never said (pause_short) anything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) My mother said
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) she always had a very good
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Suspecting
(pause_short) And I was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) One day she said
(vocal_noises_inhalation) go up (pause_medium) to my room
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and get some information out of my purse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I went there
it was full (pause_short) of money
(pause_medium) And
(pause_medium) I had the impulse to take some
(pause_medium) I knew she wouldn't care
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) she probably sent me up almost to (pause_medium) take some
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I stood
(pause_medium) And then something in me said
(pause_medium) no
(pause_medium) That is MRC not (pause_short) the way (pause_medium) to live MRC
(pause_medium) And I didn't take it
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) But
(pause_medium) when you have (pause_medium) no education
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'd read a great deal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) also a lot of trash
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But I'd enjoyed readings
(LAUGHTER)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Why shouldn't you steal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Why shouldn't you go to prison
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But look (pause_short) what we're paying (pause_short) for people in prison
(vocal_noises_inhalation) instead of putting this
(pause_short) into education
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You see
(pause_medium) our (pause_short) culture
(pause_medium) MRC misses the first (pause_medium) sell MRC
(pause_medium) Which I come back I say
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And of course
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) from what I know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) so I say this with apology
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but I understand
(pause_medium) that it's vital
(pause_medium) MRC For women to love their infants MRC
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And from what I've read
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all criminals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's because they've never been loved as young
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) youngsters
(pause_medium) Yes

(vocal_noises_inhalation) that's what he wanted to know

(pause_short) I go through ten
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Ten to twelve tons of hay a month
(pause_medium) Roughly
(pause_short) You must have been (pause_short) hurting this last season
(pause_medium) How did you do that
(pause_medium) I mean it was hard for everybody
(pause_medium) and I don't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) but I've been re al steady and real loyal
We had a r (pause_medium)
and I've (pause_medium) referred him to a lotta people
(pause_medium) And (um)
(pause_short) we had a
He kept my hay price (pause_medium)
Because of (uh)
He (pause_medium)
It was the floods out in (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But see he knows how much (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And he buys hay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And actually I usually get the Wyoming hay
and it got ruined in the rain (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But not quite as good
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he kept my hay price down to a hundred and twenty five dollars a ton
Which is (pause_short) how much
(vocal_noises_inhalation) All (vocal_noises_exhalation) win ter
Delivered and stacked (vocal_noises_exhalation)
Was that a (pause_medium)
What does that boil down to per (pause_short) bale
that (pause_short) came and picked it up

(pause_medium) He's so (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Hm
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) He thinks that's wonderful
(pause_medium) Shiba's been in heat
See how she (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Squirting on him
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) He likes it
(pause_medium) This one's in heat too
(pause_medium) Cause poor mare
(pause_medium) Beamer rushes the fence
(pause_medium) pins his ears at her
(pause_medium) because he d (pause_medium)
He (pause_short) doesn't want her to get next to his mare
(pause_short) and that one
who might threaten (vocal_noises_inhalation) his mare herd
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I give lessons on him too
(vocal_noises_inhalation) his owner doesn't ride him much
(pause_medium) He (um)
He (pause_medium)
(pause_short) he rides Western English and drives
(pause_medium) And he's just as cute as can be
They're (pause_medium) identical color aren't they
(pause_medium) And she's just sure that this one's going to be it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Actually h e's doing better than my stallion
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's only three (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And we (pause_medium) tried breeding him to a mare the other day
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (SNIFF)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) A gay stallion (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) Oh I said
(pause_medium) And he's real even tempered but
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) We just had his first foal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I just turned em out to pasture together for three days
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and she was patient with him
(pause_short) Hm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But then he fell in love with her and it was (pause_medium)
(WHINNY)
(pause_medium) He was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Um
(pause_medium) what do you call it
(pause_medium) He only wanted the one mare
(pause_short) He wouldn't look at any of the others last year
(vocal_noises_inhalation) rush at her WH
(pause_medium) See if he goes
(pause_medium) See and her buddy
(pause_medium) (um)
(pause_medium) And her (um)
(pause_medium) pal of ten ye
(pause_medium) He just was so crippled up and old and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) she didn't want (pause_short) to keep the mare at home
after (pause_short) they put the other horse down
cause (pause_short) she figured she'd get frantic
(pause_medium) To make friend s
(pause_medium) Well these are (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(pause_medium) well last year I put in a whole new ring
I (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I'd had it (pause_medium) leveled when I moved here
but it w (pause_short) really wasn't level
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And the sand that I had in it (pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It had all washed down the road
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So it was hard (pause_short) as a rock
WH (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) WH
(pause_short) like riding on asphalt
So (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Well you were probably down to the hardpack
(pause_medium) I was down to clay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I had Havens come out
and (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And p ut it down in that corner
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
it just (pause_medium) was a lot nicer
(pause_medium) three hundred tons of sand brought in and spread
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It was great in the winter time
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but when it thawed
(vocal_noises_inhalation) we couldn't ride in it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So today (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and take the rest of the sand off
(pause_medium) and (uh) his son
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He was taking it to one of my students
who lives (pause_short) on the road behind me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So she got a great deal
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that I paid (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she got it a
(pause_medium) And so it was a lot cheaper than if she'd bought it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) a buck (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) a buck a ton
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The hauling is what costs so much
(pause_medium) But I'll sh (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) yeah
(pause_medium) My
my arena isn't very (pause_short) level
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well it cost her a lot less to level hers
or as (pause_medium) unlevel
(pause_medium) This is my tractor
(pause_medium) It's masquerading as an Isuzu
But (pause_short) it really is my tractor
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) My handyman did that
(pause_medium) That's my roommate (pause_medium)
(pause_short) he's hiding
(pause_medium) And then
this is the field (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) and then (pause_short) that's the gelding field
(pause_medium) And Bruge stands here half the day wanting to come in
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) And the Chestnut (pause_medium)
And then a chestnut (pause_short) with his tail to us
(pause_medium) Yeah
The chestnut is my stallion (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) And he's just as mellow as (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) He's mellower than most geldings
(pause_medium) And the mare and baby
are (pause_short) up the road
(pause_medium) If you go (pause_short) through the (pause_short) gateposts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And just go through there and look to your left
(pause_medium) And we've got (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Right now we're down to twenty horses here
Which is great (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) my roommate's old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too
(pause_medium) He's (um)
(pause_medium) had a real rough year
(pause_medium) he lost one eye
and this'll probably be his last summer and (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So we'll put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer
and (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And if he's (vocal_noises_exhalation)
if he's (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) looks like he's gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally
we'll put him down in the fall (vocal_noises_exhalation)
I'm not gonna let him wander around blind (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) It's not fair to him
(pause_medium) He's been a grand horse
(pause_medium) But none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Where do they go
(pause_medium) They get put down
and then either buried or just hauled off (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But we put em down at home
(pause_medium) (TSK) I don't (pause_medium)
I don't put them through (pause_medium) going out to the sale and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) being menh manhandled
I just (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) don't believe in that
That's probably why I'll (pause_short) always be poor (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But I do a lotta horse rescue
(pause_short) this black horse (pause_medium) of my roommate's came from
(pause_short) he was going to the killer's four years ago
(pause_medium) Not this one
The one that (pause_medium) is b (pause_short) blind now
(pause_medium) And he was considered a killer
(pause_medium) An unmanageable
(pause_medium) And he's been perfectly lovely
(pause_short) Hm
(pause_medium) So
I've had him (pause_medium) four years
(pause_short) Sold him to my roommate a couple years ago
it was her (pause_medium) second horse
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_medium) they've cleaned up in competitive trail and
(pause_medium) fox hunted him and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He's just real game
(pause_medium) And he's just great
(pause_medium) And (uh)
an (pause_short) nother one I saved from the killers
(pause_medium) the light chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) He's a mustang
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and he was way down on the sales list
(pause_medium) So I m (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I said he's VOX gonna make a wonderful hunt horse
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he did
(pause_medium) And he's absolutely lovely
(vocal_noises_inhalation) hunter jumper
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and she hunts him
(pause_medium) That's great
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We tried driving him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I used to h h (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) putting (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Driving him with a cart
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) (pause_short) Yes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There's (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He's about a quarter Belgian
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he came from around Reno Nevada
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I had this guy come out that drives Belgians and
(pause_medium) and he was gonna (pause_medium) put in fence posts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he said VOX well I don't have anything else to do VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And he asked me what I'd done to him and
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
Baby Bel (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So he (pause_medium) put the harness on
cause I don't know (pause_short) as
(pause_medium) that much about it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (um)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I said when this horse spooks
(vocal_noises_laughter) it's a pretty tremendous spook (vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX I said and you don't want him to spook VOX
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He said VOX nah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) He hooked him to the cart
(pause_medium) He got in
(pause_medium) bucked
(vocal_noises_inhalation) kicked the guy out of the cart
(vocal_noises_inhalation) took off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And I had a different gate
(pause_medium) Because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He came out the end of the barn
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) jumped (pause_medium) a four and a half foot g ate
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) The cart of course
(pause_medium) And he went tearing around this whole field
(vocal_noises_inhalation) for probably ten minutes
With (pause_short) paraphernalia
(pause_medium) probably straps hanging to him
(pause_medium) The cart was still attached
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter) The cart went through the (pause_short) gate (vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) (pause_short) Gee
(H) The c (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the cart went through the gate
I (pause_medium)
It was one of the alum inum type (pause_short) type gates
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(H) And it was flat
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he went tearing around
(pause_medium) used to be a part of a fence
See the part tha (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It just makes kind of a upside down U
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But the (pause_medium) cart knocked it over
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And sent that all flying
(pause_medium) And finally the cart's wheels got smashed enough
(vocal_noises_laughter) and he was dragging (vocal_noises_laughter) dead weight
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and I was going h oly cow
and he got trampled by (pause_short) the other horses
(pause_medium) And he liked it
(pause_medium) Real strange
(vocal_noises_inhalation) VOX Give me my Bute VOX
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But he got tram (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And another horse
was permanently lame after th (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) borderline lame anyway
an old lame (pause_medium) Appaloosa
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) On the hill
and just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He broke off a piece of his side bone
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So he's retired (pause_short) totally now
(pause_medium) Just getting fat and not working
(pause_medium) Mm
(pause_medium) And (uh)
(pause_short) but
So much for (uh) (pause_short) carts
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I walked up there (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) and
(vocal_noises_inhalation) hoping he wouldn't run over me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I took a knife with me
and I was a (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) And (um)
he h (pause_medium)
(pause_short) The only injury he had
(pause_short) the shaft was under his belly
(vocal_noises_inhalation) He had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here
(pause_medium) Small (pause_medium) tiny (pause_medium) puncture wound
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) He did a lotta (pause_medium) bruising and muscle da mage
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (um)
(pause_medium) the vet happened to be out
(pause_short) yeah I think he was (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) he'll be out for six weeks
Which was (pause_medium) the b rest of the hunt season
(pause_medium) He hunted two weekends later
(pause_medium) (PFEW)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And for (pause_medium) three week s
after I took (pause_medium)
When I take the cay (pause_short) hay cart out
(pause_medium) To feed the horses
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They'd all run and scare and spook
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I'll be darned
(pause_medium) I tell you what
(pause_medium) Forget that cart
I don't need (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Um
(pause_medium) shoot
(pause_medium) I need to go now
(pause_short) Okay
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'll just ride Canso tomorrow

(pause_short) God I didn't know it was so late
(vocal_noises_laughter) It's o kay
(pause_short) That's right
(pause_short) Anyway
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) These are the turn outs
(pause_medium) But it's pretty well arranged
(pause_medium) I'm her slave

Now w (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Uh
(pause_medium) when I do the Mak (pause_medium)
(uh) the Hane goshi
(pause_medium) instead of pulling him all the way up
(pause_medium) Like this
(pause_medium) and let go with this hand
(pause_medium) With my right hand
I'm gonna wrap his (pause_medium) right arm up
(pause_medium) Just like you would in a regular
(pause_short) Sode makikomi
(pause_medium) Then I'm gonna slam this leg up
(pause_medium) There's not much difference
(pause_short) it's a little more dynamic
(pause_medium) and it's good
(pause_medium) when you catch a bent over opponent
(pause_short) Out there in shiai
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) Or randori
(pause_medium) No need to fix your gi right now

(pause_medium) ((FALL))
I'm doing a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Pardon me
(pause_medium) Let me go back to Hane makikomi
(pause_medium) Bend over
(pause_medium) I'm just gonna kinda scoop his arms up
(pause_medium) Bring it across
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) Notice how high I get up into his crotch with that foot
(pause_medium) That gives me more lift to him
(pause_medium) Uh (pause_medium) bow
(pause_medium) Come here
(pause_medium) Bend over
(pause_medium) I've got my
(pause_short) my high collar grip on
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) Who likes to watch my feet and mess around
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm gonna give him something to watch now
(pause_medium) I'm gonna come all the way around here
(pause_medium) and as I've got him wrapped up
(pause_medium) Yep
(pause_short) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) I'm gonna come all the way around on him
(pause_medium) See it's okay if I get this foot
(pause_medium) all the way up into the side of his crotch
(pause_medium) I want to really get that lift
(pause_medium) As I get that lift
(pause_medium) I wanna get that outer winding pull
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Let's give it a try (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Bill I wanna see you throw Darren
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We need to practice Darren's Ukemi
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_medium) SM It takes too long to do the sign of star of David Nick SM
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(pause_short) Sammy Davis Junior used to do it just fine
(pause_medium) Ha jime
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) Na (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Get going
(pause_medium) There
(pause_medium) pull
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) And don't elbow me in the face
(pause_short) Ya (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You're right
(pause_medium) Watch Bill
(pause_medium) From here
(pause_medium) come all the way around
(pause_medium) to here
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then I'm gonna kick his leg up
(pause_short) Boom (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) In a Hane goshi
(vocal_noises_inhalation) With an outer winding pull
(pause_medium) It's okay if you hit it low
(pause_short) but if he's bent over
(pause_medium) you can (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) From here
(pause_medium) I don't have (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) But from here
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) I get more of a spring off with it
(pause_medium) It's gonna be hard not to call it an ippon
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And even if they don't
(pause_medium) I'm going right into Ude garami
(pause_medium) Go
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_short) Not bad
(pause_medium) Lug
(pause_medium) Try it on Bill
(pause_medium) You're in front of a Black Belt
(pause_medium) XX where he can see if he wants to
Oh (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Gotta pull going this way
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_short) I need to have him here
(pause_short) You don't have to g wrap both arms up
(pause_medium) Just one really
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) jerk him around
(pause_short) and then spring the hip up
(pause_medium) Take a high collar grip Lug
(pause_medium) you wouldn't start off like that
(pause_short) You can just swing all the way around
(pause_medium) Just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) No
(pause_medium) There's no such thing as a Hane uchi mata
(pause_medium) You fall straight on your face
(pause_medium) Oh
(pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) you don't have the outer pull (pause_short) going for you
(pause_medium) You (pause_medium) still don't have enough outer pull
(pause_medium) He oughtta be wound up on his tiptoes
(pause_short) Way out to here
(pause_medium) Spring your hip
(pause_medium) It's hard too
(pause_medium) for you
(pause_medium) Try it again
(pause_medium) And Martin if your hip joints were okay
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_short) He'd b be just perfect for you to
(pause_medium) okay
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Watch
(pause_medium) From here
(pause_medium) ((CLAP)) From right here
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) from here
(pause_medium) See that half (pause_short) half (pause_short) instep
(pause_medium) Spot the hip
(pause_medium) I'm jerking
(pause_medium) I still get under him don't I
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) Then I'm on him
(pause_medium) It's hard to control that throw
(pause_medium) Did you land off the mat
(pause_short) No no
(pause_medium) Uchi mother
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Tell you what
(pause_medium) Martin let's pull this down XXX
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) Lug (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Give a more upward
(pause_medium) round pull
(pause_medium) From here
(pause_medium) Watch
I get s (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) best (pause_short) best way to do it is to feel it I guess
(pause_medium) Bend over
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) now I jerk up
(pause_medium) first
(pause_medium) then I spin around
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) And I'm gonna let it go
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Then I'm gonna let go here
(pause_medium) see how I got you wound up
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) This is not a good throw to throw Lug in (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) I would suggest doing this throw
(pause_medium) on combatants and opponents of equal height
(pause_medium) And size
Lug would be much better (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) for a Sode makikomi (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) but not a Hande maki Hane makikomi
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Cause the Hane
(pause_medium) you add that (pause_short) spring
(pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)
I'm having to use my (pause_short) legs
(pause_medium) to throw his weight
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Instead of using (pause_medium) Sode maki komi
(pause_medium) and get the outside of his legs
(pause_medium) and I can make that a pretty throw
(pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And with the Makikomi technique with it
(pause_medium) you don't have (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) the Tsuri komi
(pause_medium) The lifting pull
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You don't have your right hand to help you with it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) All you have is an outer winding pull with the left hand
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's gotta go up
out (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) and around
(pause_medium) Let's give it a try
(pause_medium) Throw (pause_short) throw Bill again
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) (GRUNT)
(pause_short) That's better
(pause_medium) Much better
(pause_medium) Now let's throw it again
(pause_medium) and think about where the foot goes
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) Just one moment
(pause_medium) The more acute (pause_short) angle
(pause_medium) that that knee gets at
(pause_medium) the more MRC power w you have with your spring MRC from your hip joint
(pause_medium) From here
(pause_medium) even if I'm doing Hane goshi
(pause_medium) if I get that
(pause_short) that knee bent
(pause_medium) well I can blast him
(pause_medium) from here
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) I've got (pause_short) a lot of spring with it
(pause_medium) Also
(pause_medium) lay the (pause_medium) instep of the foot
(pause_medium) Toes extremely well pointed
(pause_medium) To the inside
(pause_medium) of his calf
(pause_short) I mean his
(pause_medium) his (uh) (pause_medium) thigh
(pause_medium) I don't care if your heel slides up into his crotch
(pause_medium) For a (pause_short) a (pause_short) Hane makikomi
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) (uh) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Hane goshi
(pause_medium) I'd prefer that you do it a little bit different
(pause_medium) the higher up it gets
(pause_medium) Yoshi
(pause_medium) Is this the right (pause_medium) position here
(pause_medium) Your knees need to be bent
(pause_medium) Now pull
and spr (pause_short) and spring
(pause_medium) Spring
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) I'm just trying to get this
(pause_medium) even though he's bent over
(pause_medium) I still have to get in
(pause_medium) Okay
Look at his (pause_short) look at his heels
(pause_medium) Is his heel up
(pause_medium) Yes
(pause_medium) Alright from here
(pause_medium) now I've g I'm got to be lower
(vocal_noises_inhalation) come on back side of the hands
(pause_short) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) And then I spring him off
(pause_medium) If he's bent over
(pause_medium) it's extremely hard for me to get (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) under him
with a standard (pause_medium) Tsuri komi grip
(pause_medium) Well this way I'm just scooting my butt in there on him
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) It doesn't matter if I hit him
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) a little bit above my his obi
(pause_medium) with my buttocks
(pause_medium) As long as
(pause_medium) that leg is automatically cocking as it goes in
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Then I'm throwing my weight straight forward (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) With that outer winding pull
(pause_medium) It's all important
(pause_medium) Jerk him around
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) Bill went into Uchi mata
(pause_medium) I might have to have you throw Uchi mata a couple times
(pause_medium) Think of it (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) as a very short
(pause_medium) inverted kick
(pause_medium) Like that
(pause_medium) You know how you can use
(pause_medium) ((SLAP))
(pause_medium) inverted kick
(pause_medium) Up very close range
(pause_short) That's exactly what you're doing
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Kicking the inside of his thigh
(pause_medium) Okay
(pause_medium) This time do an inverted kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it
(pause_medium) Go into it and load him up two or three times (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Uchi komi (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Bend your knees as you go in too
(pause_medium) You're just straight and (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) 'S better
(pause_medium) Now throw
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Relax and throw
(pause_medium) ((FALL)) (GRUNT)
(pause_medium) You're still sliding up that leg
(pause_medium) Bill
(pause_medium) Throw me
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Thank you
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
Okay it was (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Now I'm gonna be a sucker
(pause_medium) This (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Now you're just walking in on me man
(pause_medium) Jerk me to you
(pause_medium) Hoo
(pause_medium) Not quite far enough in (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) A little shaky
(pause_medium) as long as you're getting my head
(pause_medium) to where it'll clear
(pause_medium) Make me a happy camper
(pause_medium) Ah
(pause_medium) here
(pause_short) an added exp (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) an added attraction
(pause_medium) What are we gonna do now
(pause_medium) I've got my hand on your hip
(pause_short) There we go
(pause_medium) That's it beau
(pause_medium) Throw
(pause_medium) (GRUNT)
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I was gonna get that arm free (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Good
(pause_medium) One of these
(pause_medium) You will
(pause_medium) Think I did
(pause_medium) (THROAT)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_short) Turn on in on s with something
(pause_medium) Turn in to anything
(pause_medium) Can't
(pause_medium) Now I'm playing you back (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) F Oh F
(pause_short) Hane makikomi now
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) Boy that's a hard fall (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (Hx)
(pause_medium) Ippon
(pause_medium) (GASP)
(pause_medium) Now (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) the traditional way to do it
(pause_medium) is not all bent over
(pause_medium) It's from a regular grip (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And I'll still go
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) Not a real (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Which w that one wasn't a very clean pretty throw
(pause_medium) XX functional
(pause_medium) Ah f (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) had my leg stayed lower
(pause_medium) Traditional Hane
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Hane (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Goshi (vocal_noises_exhalation) leg (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) That was pretty
(pause_medium) But I like the Hane makikomi
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) when it's used on a player (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) who's fighting you in that
(pause_medium) extreme (vocal_noises_exhalation) defensive stance
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) While he's down in a deep jigo
(pause_short) Preferably
(pause_medium) with his left foot forward
(pause_medium) Pressing against you with that left hand
(pause_medium) Keeping you out
(pause_medium) Doing this number
(pause_medium) Goes in
(vocal_noises_inhalation) see he's already eliminated this place (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) All you have to do is jerk me around to it and come to me
(pause_medium) Jerk
(pause_medium) Hook
(pause_medium) And then spring me right there
(pause_medium) That's it
(pause_medium) Alright

(pause_medium) a (uh)
(pause_short) Sode makikomi
(pause_short) This is just what it feels like from this position
(pause_medium) So I'm gonna get ready to step over
(pause_medium) O kay
(pause_medium) And just as I get ready to step from here
(pause_medium) kick that leg in
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) There I go
(pause_medium) Alright come here Bill
(pause_medium) Watch it Darren
(pause_medium) I mean (uh)
(pause_medium) Benton
(pause_medium) Alright (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) tell me if this
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) Sode makikomi
(pause_medium) Now (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) there we go
(pause_short) no
just (pause_short) don't counter
(vocal_noises_inhalation) There
(pause_short) Alright now
(pause_short) I can finish up
(pause_medium) He off mat
(pause_medium) No
he just (pause_short) hit his hand
(pause_medium) Oh
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_laughter)(vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) I guess since he's off the mat
he didn't wanna hurt his (pause_medium) arm s
(pause_medium) He's used to wearing a watch
try and protect it (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Come throw him a little bit Benton
(pause_medium) There (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) Now th
(pause_medium) shoot it now
(pause_medium) YELL Ha YELL
(pause_medium) You had a perfect position with the foot
(pause_medium) XXX
(pause_medium) Jed
(pause_short) in the front
(pause_medium) XXX
(pause_short) I've noticed something that your sensei is doing that you're not doing
(pause_medium) He's reaching for the mat
(pause_medium) He's in there and winds up
(pause_medium) he's reaching for the mat
(pause_medium) with this arm
(pause_short) And your arm's way up here high
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and your sensei
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is VOX way down like this VOX
(pause_medium) See the difference
(pause_medium) So you're wrapping
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you're thinking
(pause_medium) and (pause_medium) Nick
(vocal_noises_inhalation) is going for the mat with this arm
He's (vocal_noises_inhalation) into a f
almost like a forward roll (pause_short) mode
(pause_medium) The other difference that I noticed between you (vocal_noises_exhalation) and your sensei is that
(pause_medium) this foot is way out here
(pause_short) This (pause_short) the
(pause_medium) your
(pause_medium) Are they trying to throw over the entire hip se ction
with th (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And and and and
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) so pretty like he does
(vocal_noises_inhalation) his foot
(pause_short) of his opponent's center of gravity
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) S you're so wide that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) when you lift up to make the springing motion
(pause_medium) what happens is
(pause_medium) That is it
(pause_medium) enough to go like that
(pause_medium) Try it one time
(pause_medium) Reach for the ground with your (pause_medium) wrapping (pause_medium) arm
(pause_medium) Uh (uh) (uh) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Reach
Here here here's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Reach VOX way like this VOX
(pause_medium) And (pause_short) and stand on this foot
(pause_medium) are more balanced
(pause_medium) Just a little bit more
(pause_medium) No step deeper
(pause_short) Step deeper
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_medium) Look how d (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_medium) Get your foot over here
(pause_short) That foot
(pause_medium) Now
(pause_short) Oh
(pause_short) Ah so
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) Try it again
(pause_medium) Alright
what hi (pause_medium)
what (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Mhm
(pause_medium) Step directly between his legs
(pause_medium) No no no no no
(pause_short) not between his leg s
(pause_short) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) The more you reach that arm through
(pause_medium) L let me add one (pause_medium)
to make it (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) throwing it contest style
(vocal_noises_inhalation) somebody once told me
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) all the Makikomi waza
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) was (pause_short) to go down (pause_medium) like this
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and to take this foot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and stick it VOX all the way through VOX l ike thi s
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And just stick it
(pause_medium) All the way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) behind you
(pause_short) like this
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and you roll like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and if you do this
(pause_short) (uh) (pause_short) in demo fashion
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you'll be so low to the ground
(vocal_noises_inhalation) by the time that your opponent (pause_medium) hits the ground (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) And that way I mean (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you can intensify
((SLAP)) (pause_short) throw it harder
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But the mark of a (pause_medium) good (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) judo throw
is to be able to (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they can do (pause_medium)
and it doesn't even hurt (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) So you can do that
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) by sticking that leg (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) all the way through
As you get (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) You follow what I'm saying
(pause_medium) Yes sir
(pause_medium) You don't have to drive em through the mat
that's a way that you can (vocal_noises_exhalation)
practice it over and over (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and be so low to the ground (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's about as good as you can get a Makikomi for your uke
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's really not that bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you could (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it's it's (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium)
and (pause_short) let him see
(pause_medium) Alright
(pause_medium) coming in like this (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) ((FALL))
(pause_medium) alright
(pause_medium) Look at his body position right here
(pause_medium) There is no (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) You couldn't slide a postcard between us
(pause_medium) I don't think you'd even do it between the hip (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Well do you wanna do one more
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Here's a nice place to put my shoe s
