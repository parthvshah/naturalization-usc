They (pause_medium) did have an (pause_short) autopsy (pause_short) done (pause_short) on her
It (pause_short) surprised (pause_medium) me
But (pause_short) they
(pause_medium) And it (pause_short) was actually a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
One side (pause_short) of (pause_short) her (pause_medium) heart was just hard (pause_medium)
the (uh) muscle
from just (pause_short) labored breathing (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) That's just (pause_short) sick
Yeah (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) we (pause_medium) didn't (pause_medium) realize what she was going (pause_short) through
And you (pause_short) know (uh)
(pause_short) maybe that's another (pause_medium) reason why (pause_medium) she didn't (pause_short) really
maybe mom (pause_short) she kinda knew (pause_short) about (pause_short) all this (pause_medium) stuff (pause_medium)
pay that much (pause_medium) attention (pause_short) to (pause_short) Amanda
(pause_medium) I mean it (pause_short) seems (pause_medium) like (pause_medium) she'd (pause_short) pay more attention to her (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) last forever for (pause_short) her
I mean (pause_medium)
(pause_short) well (pause_short) if I go
(uh) You know
(pause_short) Yeah
(pause_medium) It's just too bad (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I (pause_short) just (pause_medium) hope Orville and Genetta get (pause_short) that little girl (pause_medium)
(pause_short) there's no
They can't (uh)
They want her three (pause_short) months (pause_short) out of (pause_medium) the (um) year (pause_medium)
You (pause_medium) know
there's not much (pause_short) they (pause_medium) can do (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Mhm
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) This is the (pause_short) type (pause_short) of person
that is (pause_medium) like (uh) a hermit (uh)
(pause_medium) I (pause_medium) don't know what (pause_medium) you'd (pause_short) call him

Well (pause_short) they were (pause_medium) rai (pause_short) raised backward
(pause_medium) He's like
Uh (pause_medium)
back (pause_medium) woods
Back woodsy (pause_medium)
didn't (pause_medium) d
(pause_short) Never came (pause_medium) down (pause_short) out of the mountains (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He doesn't have any (pause_medium)
He doesn't know (pause_medium) what's (pause_short) going (pause_medium) on (uh) in this (pause_short) world
No he (pause_medium) doesn't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He (pause_short) was (pause_medium) just not 2properly (pause_short) brought up2
He (um)
(pause_medium) Um
I forget (uh)
(pause_short) Um Macley
Arco (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Isn't that (pause_short) where Deb kinda (pause_medium) was
(pause_short) But he's just really (pause_medium) really (pause_medium) really strange (pause_medium)
