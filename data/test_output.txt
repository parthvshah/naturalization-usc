They (uh) did have (pause_medium) an autopsy (pause_short) done on her (uh)
(pause_medium) It surprised me (pause_medium)
But (um) they
(pause_short) And it (pause_short) was (pause_medium) actually a
(pause_short) Mhm
One side (pause_medium) of her (pause_medium) heart (pause_short) was just (pause_medium) hard
(pause_medium) the muscle
from just labored (pause_medium) breathing (pause_medium)
That's just (pause_medium) sick (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) we (pause_medium) didn't realize what (pause_medium) she was going through (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) And (uh) you know
(pause_medium) maybe that's (pause_medium) another (pause_short) reason why she (pause_medium) didn't really
maybe mom she (pause_short) kinda (pause_short) knew about (pause_short) all (pause_medium) this stuff (pause_medium)
pay (pause_short) that (uh) much attention to Amanda (uh)
I mean (pause_short) it (pause_medium) seems like she'd (pause_medium) pay (pause_medium) more attention to (um) her (pause_medium)
last (uh) forever (pause_medium) for her
(pause_medium) I mean
(pause_medium) well if I go (uh)
You (pause_short) know
Yeah (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It's just too bad (pause_medium)
I (pause_medium) just hope Orville and (uh) Genetta get that (pause_short) little (pause_short) girl (uh)
there's (pause_short) no
They can't (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) They want her three months out (pause_short) of (pause_medium) the (pause_medium) year (uh)
You (pause_short) know
there's (pause_short) not much they (pause_medium) can do (pause_medium)
Mhm (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Yeah
This (pause_short) is (pause_short) the type of person (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that is (pause_medium) like a (pause_medium) hermit
(pause_medium) I don't (pause_medium) know (pause_short) what you'd (pause_short) call him

(pause_medium) Well they were rai (pause_short) raised (pause_medium) backward
(pause_medium) He's like
(pause_short) Uh
back woods (um)
Back woodsy (pause_medium)
didn't d (pause_medium)
Never came (pause_short) down (pause_short) out of the (pause_medium) mountains (pause_medium)
(pause_short) He doesn't have any (pause_medium)
He doesn't (pause_medium) know (pause_medium) what's going on (pause_medium) in (pause_short) this (pause_medium) world
(pause_medium) No (pause_short) he doesn't
He (pause_medium) was just (pause_medium) not (pause_short) 2properly brought (pause_short) up2
(pause_short) He
(pause_medium) Um
I (pause_medium) forget
(pause_medium) Um Macley
(pause_medium) Arco
(pause_medium) Isn't that where (pause_medium) Deb kinda (pause_medium) was
(pause_medium) But (pause_medium) he's just really really (pause_short) really strange (pause_medium)
