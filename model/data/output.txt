(pause_medium) So you don't need to go (pause_medium) borrow equipment from anybody
to (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) to do the feet
(pause_medium) Do the hooves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) something (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) So
Mae (pause_medium)
I'm gonna (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) to do those
cause y (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) n you just
(pause_medium) it takes (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) and I'm not as good
as like somebody that would do it (pause_short) all the time
(pause_short) You know
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Oh (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) (vocal_noises_laughter) I'm not (uh) (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know how to say it
(pause_medium) most people that you would get to trim your horse do it (pause_short) all the time
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and I'm not (vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_medium) that good or
(pause_short) and I'm not very strong
Did they train you (pause_medium)
2Did2 they train you that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) yeah
(pause_short) So you have your own equipment
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
(pause_medium) Dad
(pause_medium) you know
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) of kinda how to do it
or (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) people come to our place
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) and
(pause_medium) (TSK) (pause_medium) I don't know
(pause_medium) down there
(um)
you have to (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) you have to take this class
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you can only take (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) if you wanna go on in it
you n (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And I decided to go ahead and go on in it
(pause_short) And the first part of it
(pause_short) is like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well we have lecture
(pause_short) then we have lab
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And like
(pause_short) we just go into the classroom
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work
(pause_short) I mean
(pause_medium) it (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) they go over
(pause_short) the whole
(pause_medium) the whole part (pause_short) of the horse
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) all the skeleton (pause_short) part of it you know
and (pause_medium)
and they go through (pause_short) every kinda ligament
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) millions of ligaments
and millions of (pause_short) tendons
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(pause_medium) and
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) the bone in the hoof
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) then all the (pause_short) wall
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he went over on how to trim it
and where you (pause_medium)
and a horse (pause_short) has this little white line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you clean it out with the (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (TSK) with the hoof knife
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and then there (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) and then you can see this little white line
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and that's kinda where you go by
to (pause_medium)
SM (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) you know
(pause_short) has that (pause_short) little white line right the re
and that 's where you kinda SM (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) kinda need a little guide
(pause_short) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) I am still scared to do it
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) By doing it
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And make em
and they're just (pause_short) a little bit
for f (pause_medium)
I mean they're just (pause_short) sore
(vocal_noises_inhalation) That's not bad
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they m (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) they have to
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) keep em (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) away from anything
(pause_short) no (pause_short) hard pebbles
or hard (pause_short) clods of dirt or anything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_medium) (Hx) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I don't know
I'm (pause_short) a little scared (pause_short) about doing it yet
(pause_short) When I get done with them
(vocal_noises_inhalation) SM A lot of times
and I'll look at (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and it's still
(pause_short) it's too (pause_short) long
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And then like
(pause_medium) I would never
(pause_short) ever
(pause_short) ever
(pause_short) to shoe a horse
(pause_short) See we did that too
we did (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We did a lot of stuff
we did a lot of stuff with the (pause_medium)
(um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) the burners
and you'd put the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you'd have (pause_medium)
you started out with the straight (pause_short) iron
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and you'd stick it into the
(pause_short) into the
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know like
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you'd put it into the hot SM (pause_short) coals
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then
we'd (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
and we'd make it a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) We just put the shoes that were already made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And that's as far as we got
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Well as a matter of fact
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is really funny
there isn't (pause_short) really (pause_short) any girl farriers (pause_short) around anywhere
They're really (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) th Yeah
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And the m (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) the reason they were showing us this at college
(pause_short) to get us
(vocal_noises_inhalation) to know if our trimmer
and shoer were_s (pause_short) doing it right
and (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments
(pause_short) we had it in another class too
we (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) that was kind of a double thing that
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) we had in (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) in another class
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well it was a review for some people
(vocal_noises_inhalation) if it was a review or not
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But
(pause_medium) (TSK) anyway
(um)
(pause_medium) PAR P what was I gonna say
(pause_short) I forgot what I was think (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) w um
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) when we put em on a horse's hoof
(vocal_noises_inhalation) they're already made
(pause_short) they're round
(pause_short) we pick out a size
(pause_short) you know we'd
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this is a double aught
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) this is
(pause_short) what s (pause_medium)
(pause_short) and double aught and aught
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) are the (pause_short) ones that are most popular
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) For
(pause_medium) (TSK) you know
the (pause_medium)
that's a d (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Or ponies
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But we're talking just the regular
(pause_short) light horses you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And
aught and aught (pause_medium)
(uh) aught
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well anyway
you go get your (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Okay
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And you go get your shoe
(pause_short) It's already made
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) _You go look
every horse is gonna have (pause_short) a little (pause_short) different shape
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And so what you have to 2do2
So every (pause_medium)
2every2 (uh)
horseshoe is made (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) No no
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) No
What (pause_medium)
then that's (pause_short) that's where the ferrier comes in
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Every shoe
(pause_short) you get order
You'd get (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) The ferrier gets em
(pause_short) You know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And then
(pause_medium) (TSK) _Our job
(pause_short) to the horse's foot
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And that
(pause_short) but it's really hard to do
(pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) some of em you have to
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
say your shoe's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) like this
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) and your horse's foot is just really wide or something
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Well then you have to put it on the anvil
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well then once you stretch the shoe out
(pause_short) well then
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the two corners
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You stretch this out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) then you have to round these back
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it s it sounds easy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I would never do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean we had to do it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod
(pause_short) I mean
that's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) thirty bucks
for twenty horses (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(pause_medium) Jesus
that would be a th (pause_short) nine hundred dollars
(pause_medium) SM I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) So
(pause_medium) w you know
(pause_medium) like
(pause_short) that have a lot of horses and stuff
(pause_short) and that they're riding a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) let the college kids do em
(pause_short) For em you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They're taking the risk
(pause_short) of having their horse (pause_medium) get lame
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) It really never happens
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And it's not like
(pause_short) there's a person that's just gung ho
(vocal_noises_inhalation) trims their feet
(pause_short) all the time I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) he e (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) so it's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But (uh)
(pause_medium) P PAR What was I gonna say PAR P
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Oh
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And it (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you get so (pause_medium)
I've (pause_medium) only done like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) well (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_medium) at the end of the year
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) right now
(pause_short) only shod about
(pause_short) five horses
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Trimmed a lot of em
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And you know what we start out with
(vocal_noises_inhalation) We start out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) with
(pause_short) dead horse hooves
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_short) The people that (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that (pause_medium)
(pause_short) kill the horses for meat and stuff
(pause_short) You know they have all these legs and stuff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I don't know
everybody (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
I thought they used the (THROAT) the horsehooves in (pause_short) for gelatin
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) HI You know
(pause_short) then they
(pause_short) they probably use em for everything (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
we (pause_short) (TSK) get (pause_short) these horse hooves
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they (pause_medium)
(pause_short) a long ways to go get em
to get these (pause_short) horse hooves
(vocal_noises_inhalation) For the college
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They go back (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_short) East
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) So we have this frozen horse hoof
cause you don't want to (pause_short) cripple up a (pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) really good horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) that horse would have been
(pause_short) lame
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) like crazy
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But (vocal_noises_laughter)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it was just
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit
(pause_short) they start really stinking and stuff
(vocal_noises_inhalation) HI I mean
you have this HI (vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) piece of horse (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) HI I mean this leg that's (vocal_noises_laughter) HI
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And like in some of em
(pause_medium) (TSK) blood will spurt out
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's nothing (vocal_noises_laughter) (pause_medium)
SM (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's the grossest thing SM
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's why (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory
it's just the (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But once you get into it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But
(pause_medium) I would have never got into that class
if (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's no way
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I heard everybody saying (um) (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) talking about
(pause_medium) VOX Oh
(vocal_noises_inhalation) and they stink VOX
I'm never (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And then once I got into it
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) But
(vocal_noises_exhalation) (pause_short) (TSK) at first it was kind of a bummer
(pause_medium) But
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I'm glad I took it
(pause_medium) Really glad
(pause_medium) (TSK) It pays off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) twelve bucks
(pause_medium) I mean that's twelve bucks
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You know
(pause_short) with
(pause_short) a horse that I was really using a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) that's still twelve dollars
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) shoot
(pause_medium) But
anybody (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
(TSK) (pause_medium) I wanna wait until the morning
(pause_short) to do that
(pause_short) because
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's just
(pause_medium) too hot in the afternoon
(vocal_noises_inhalation) I mean you can get
(pause_short) just
(pause_short) exhausted
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Anyway
I was gonna tell you about that (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) the girl
there isn't mary (pause_short) very many
(pause_short) ferrier girls you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This summer I met one
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Jorgensen's
they have (pause_medium) one (pause_short) shoer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And I guess like in Minnesota it's real wet
(pause_short) and stuff you know
(pause_short) they really have to watch their shoes
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's like
and they're not (pause_short) as dry or anything
(vocal_noises_inhalation) When you get back here
we have to watch out for like (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) like the hooves being too dry
(vocal_noises_inhalation) The (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Not this time of the year
(pause_short) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) usually they're too wet
and that (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) that shoe can just pull right off
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) the hoof wall is so soft
(pause_medium) Yeah
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
and I nei (pause_medium)
(pause_short) I didn't realize that in (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Sure it's gonna be softer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But I never even thought about that until I took this class
So it's (pause_medium)
you know that's (pause_short) kinda stuff too that you think about
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But anyway
(pause_medium) (TSK) they always have this one horseshoer
(vocal_noises_inhalation) this girl's been (pause_short) in this ferrier
(pause_medium) (uh)
she's going to an actual (pause_short) ferrier college
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They have a lot of those around
(pause_short) a lot
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And she's going to one of em
(pause_short) like nine months
(pause_short) to this one
(uh)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) left to go
(pause_medium) What
(pause_medium) Guess I'll put it on
(pause_short) (um)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) she (pause_medium)
he's like taking her as a (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) you know
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) it's really different
you just (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) don't see that
(pause_medium) at all
(pause_short) ever
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Jorgensen's have a (pause_medium) girl (pause_medium)
(pause_short) or a g (pause_medium)
(pause_short) you know a guy
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they
are (um)
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) there's this girl
(pause_medium) Yeah
(pause_medium) I couldn't believe it
(pause_medium) She's a tiny girl
she's got arms the size of (pause_medium)
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) they're huge
but she must only (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) HI What is m (pause_medium) blowing out of there HI
it's just (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) it gets dust accumulated in it
(pause_medium) It was just on last night
I (pause_medium)
It (pause_short) Mae Lynne
(pause_short) for one thing the (pause_short) filters are dirty because it (pause_short) it so (pause_medium)
(pause_short) been so dry
(pause_medium) And the (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it all comes acrost
(pause_medium) the road
(pause_short) you know
(pause_short) and
(pause_short) and then it builds up real bad with
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) (COUGH) deposits
In other words I (pause_short) should be (pause_short) change filters
(pause_medium) God
(pause_medium) I know
(pause_medium) It won't last long
(pause_medium) But
(pause_short) it sure does make a mess in the house
(pause_medium) Anyway
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) I mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) She's out there just
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) working away
(pause_medium) And
(pause_short) trim and trim and trim
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_short) And shoe
(pause_short) for me (vocal_noises_exhalation)
(pause_short) that's something I'm not used to
(vocal_noises_inhalation) you just (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) HI it's HI tiring
(pause_medium) The very (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) at the very beginning
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Then we moved up to two
(pause_short) Then we moved up to a full horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And
(pause_medium) We were just slowly got in shape
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But now if I went to do that
(pause_medium) I'd never be able to handle it
(pause_medium) It's just (pause_medium)
it's a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) It is really hard work
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) You're bent over
and it's (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) you know
it takes (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) like (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either
(vocal_noises_inhalation) (pause_medium) it's just hard hard work
It's (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) it doesn't seem like it would be
(pause_medium) (SWALLOW) it is
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Those (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) It's hard
(pause_short) (TSK) I've never been kicked
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) But like
(vocal_noises_inhalation) most people's horse
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And they
(pause_medium) they don't get by with stuff
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation) you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) horses at college
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) it's like a kid
(pause_medium) are ornery
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And like
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) (pause_medium) kinda be ornery about half way
but not (pause_medium) not too bad
(pause_medium) I've never been (pause_short) kicked doing it at all
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know
just had to learn (pause_medium) our safety of
(vocal_noises_inhalation) where to stand
(pause_short) (vocal_noises_inhalation) You have to stand like these certain ways
(pause_short) oh and it's a killer on your back
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You're standing (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_laughter) (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_medium) You're standing like this you know
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And like
the horse's hoof (pause_medium) _lays like this right over you
(pause_short) like this working
(vocal_noises_inhalation) This is like a hoof knife
then a (pause_medium)
(pause_short) And like in the front
(vocal_noises_inhalation) You stick the horse's hoof (pause_short) between your leg
(pause_medium) (TSK) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Kinda like that
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It's really hard on your back
(pause_short) Like
(pause_short) I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous
(pause_medium) Couldn't believe it
(pause_medium) She had like on this (pause_short) really (pause_short) p kinda short shirt
(vocal_noises_inhalation)
There's this (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) I think that's cold
(pause_medium) Just don't (pause_medium)
(pause_short) it's (pause_medium)
it's just (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Makes a sound
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Nkay
(pause_medium) So what (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what were you gonna do out there today
What other (pause_medium)
(pause_short) what other things were you gonna (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) (vocal_noises_inhalation) Just go out and (um)
