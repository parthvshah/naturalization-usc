(vocal_noises_inhalation) They did have an autopsy done on her (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) It surprised me
But they (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) it was (um) actually a
(pause_short) Mhm
(vocal_noises_inhalation) One side (pause_short) of her heart (pause_short) was (pause_medium) just hard
(vocal_noises_inhalation) the muscle
from (pause_medium) just (pause_medium) labored breathing
That's (pause_short) just sick (pause_medium)
Yeah (vocal_noises_laughter)
we (pause_short) didn't realize (pause_short) what she (vocal_noises_inhalation) was going through
(vocal_noises_inhalation) And (pause_short) you know
(pause_medium) maybe (pause_short) that's another reason why she didn't (pause_short) really
maybe mom (vocal_noises_inhalation) she (pause_medium) kinda knew (pause_short) about (pause_short) all this stuff
(pause_short) pay that much attention (pause_short) to (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) Amanda
(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) I mean (pause_short) it seems (pause_medium) like (uh) she'd pay more attention to her
last forever for (pause_medium) her (pause_medium)
I (pause_short) mean
(vocal_noises_inhalation) well (vocal_noises_exhalation) if I go
(pause_medium) You know
Yeah (pause_medium)
It's just too (pause_short) bad (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)
(pause_short) I just (pause_short) hope Orville (vocal_noises_inhalation) and (um) Genetta get that (pause_medium) little girl
there's no (uh)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) They can't
They want her (pause_medium) three months out (pause_short) of the year (pause_medium)
You know (pause_medium)
there's not much (pause_short) they (vocal_noises_laughter) can do (pause_medium)
Mhm (pause_medium)
Yeah (pause_medium)
This (pause_short) is the (pause_short) type of (pause_medium) person
that (pause_short) is (vocal_noises_laughter) like (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) a hermit
I don't (pause_medium) know (pause_short) what you'd call him (pause_medium)

(pause_medium) Well they were (pause_medium) rai raised backward
(pause_medium) He's like
Uh (pause_medium)
back (vocal_noises_glottal_stop) woods
Back woodsy (vocal_noises_laughter)
didn't d (pause_medium)
Never came down out (pause_short) of (pause_short) the (pause_short) mountains
He doesn't have any (pause_medium)
(pause_medium) He doesn't know what's going on in (pause_medium) this world (pause_medium)
No he doesn't (pause_medium)
He (pause_short) was (pause_medium) just (pause_medium) not 2properly brought up2
He (vocal_noises_inhalation)
(pause_short) Um
I forget (pause_medium)
(vocal_noises_inhalation) Um Macley
Arco (pause_medium)
(pause_short) Isn't that (pause_short) where Deb (pause_medium) kinda was
(vocal_noises_inhalation) But (vocal_noises_laughter) he's just (pause_medium) really really really (pause_medium) strange
